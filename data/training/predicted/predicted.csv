Walking slowly down one side of the banquet room, the eeriness of the place seemed to drift about me and cling to the air in a cold embrace. I could almost hear the music that had once been played in this abandoned hall. Many a wedding reception or party had gone on here, it looked well used. Now, no one would ever dance here again. Hearing a creak behind me and the familiar guttural noise a feral vampire makes, I turned and could hear footsteps approaching me from behind one of the piles of debris stacked high to one side. I pulled out my hatchet, expecting to take them down quickly. Instead I found what used to be a woman. She reached toward me with her",-0.04366371626965702

The ground was soft, accommodating my footsteps as I walked. The floor looked similar to a checkers board. A golden, colossal chandelier adorned the middle of the ruby-red, fluffy ceiling. Columns stood on the far side of the room, each incrusted with deep-green emeralds. Exposed halls were visible from the bottom, where I stood. There was a series of upside-down doors along the sidewalls. The room was glorious and full of life. ""You must pick a room, all the members have one. Here is where you will sleep, on this side of the House."" Ms. Baynes pulled up her orange dress and placed her foot on one of the silvery steps. ""What are you waiting for, dear? C'mon."" Once we had made it to the second level, she lightly grabbed me by the arm and said, ""Any door that's not taken can be yours.

The floor was terrazzo, smooth polished marble assembled from different colored pieces, the pattern of the pieces forming a map of the world complete with a compass in one corner and sea serpents poking up from the oceans. More overstuffed leather chairs were scattered around the periphery, and a well stocked bar was tucked along one corner, rows and rows of expensive looking bottles arrayed against a mirrored wall. Again, this room was empty of people. I ran around the room, looking for another door but not finding one. I walked to the center of the room and looked around. I felt a strange sense of déjà vu followed by a rising feeling of panic. I looked at my phone and saw that I had no signal. Taking slow breaths, I tried to remain calm and think things through.

Doris didn't press, she simply watched and waited, as was her way. ""I have a bit of an odd problem."" She looked down in her lap, wondering how her mother would react to what she was about to say. ""The sheriff has made a rather insistent declaration to court me."" In response, Doris broke into a bright smile and clapped her hands together. ""Problem? This is a blessing! It's just what we've been waiting for!"" Valerie's head dropped even lower between her shoulders. ""We both know it's not that simple."" The unspoken truth passed between them, and Doris' exuberance cooled. ""Valerie, I know you feel badly about not being able to carry, but that's not all there is to a marriage."" She cringed as the pain of her situation stung her once again. ""I know, Mama. But the men around here don't seem to care much about anything else.

There were several close line calls where they gave their opponent the benefit of the doubt. On one point Petie called a shot on the sideline good, but the boy overruled him. ""I had a better view Pete, it was clearly out."" After the match was over the boys talked for twenty minutes and exchanged phone numbers. It turned out that Ron lived in New Port Richey, only 30 minutes from our house. Petie had reached the semi-finals, and made a new friend.

The plows pulled by oxen had been replaced by industrial tractors with enclosed, air conditioned cabs. The wagon train that moved a herd across thousands of miles of open, untouched land had been replaced with vehicles driven in shifts.

While some details of the dream were blurry, she could clearly see her grandfather's face, his mouth stretched out comically to accommodate the words. Time stretched and popped again. They were now at the little island. Grandfather got out and dragged the boat up onto the island. Placing big hands on both sides of Kimberly's waist, he hauled her up and over the side of the boat.

The house was also on high enough ground to overlook the valley below and in the distance, nestled between the hills, stood the city. A few hundred meters past the house the ground rose dramatically and changed from mere hills to the mountain where the changing aspens made it look like it was on fire.

She had then dressed Larry in girl clothing and had him attend school as a female, under the name Evelyn, until the fifth grade. The small, mountain town had no knowledge of Larry's actual gender.

Because the children's home was too expensive she was forced to leave Thomas on a trawler, which had been converted into a houseboat. This was to prove his earliest childhood memory.

He wore a yellow sash around his waist and the customary pouches on belts worn over his shoulder, with a large pack on his back.

Round the hem, just over where the undershift came out, bands of crimson and purple were woven onto it. She wore a purple cloak over her shoulders, and its hood showed crimson. She wore too her mother's silver belt, and a wimple. Now Swanhild spoke to Skarphedin in a low voice: 'Let us go somewhat apart from these, or else behind them.

Archendorf, however, seemed a little more prepared. He wore a leather jerkin, a woollen undershirt, a thick hardwearing pair of pants and heavy brown boots that looked good for stomping about in lava pits.

As the dog grunted, the goat woke up and started bleating incessantly. It was especially scared because of the presence of the dog.

This voice startled some timid people, but added weight and confirmation to the subject I was urging.

There was a large metal structure of sorts running from the top of the waterfall over to the top of the castle.

The door leading to the highest tower was boarded up but that was no impediment to a Shadow, but his scouting little availed him.

444,"Biodiesel is a form of diesel fuel derived from plants or animals and consisting of long-chain fatty acid esters. It is typically made by chemically reacting lipids such as animal fat (tallow), soybean oil, or some other vegetable oil with an alcohol, producing a methyl, ethyl or propyl ester. Unlike the vegetable and waste oils used to fuel converted diesel engines, biodiesel is a drop-in biofuel, meaning it is compatible with existing diesel engines and distribution infrastructure. However, it is usually blended with petrodiesel (typically to less than 10%) since most engines cannot run on pure Biodiesel without modification. Biodiesel blends can also be used as heating oil. The US National Biodiesel Board defines ""biodiesel"" as a mono-alkyl ester. Blends of biodiesel and conventional hydrocarbon-based diesel are most commonly distributed for use in the retail diesel fuel marketplace. Much of the world uses a system known as the ""B"" factor to state the amount of biodiesel in any fuel mix: Blends of 20% biodiesel and lower can be used in diesel equipment with no, or only minor modifications, although certain manufacturers do",-2.2815131068229677

Characterization of exhaust emissions showed significant emission reductions compared to regular diesel. Biodiesel has a number of standards for its quality including European standard EN 14214, ASTM International D6751, and others. When biodiesel is cooled below a certain point, some of the molecules aggregate and form crystals. The fuel starts to appear cloudy once the crystals become larger than one quarter of the wavelengths of visible light – this is the cloud point (CP). As the fuel is cooled further these crystals become larger. The lowest temperature at which fuel can pass through a 45micrometre filter is the cold filter plugging point (CFPP). As biodiesel is cooled further it will gel and then solidify. Within Europe, there are differences in the CFPP requirements between countries. This is reflected in the different national standards of those countries.

Biodiesel contains virtually no sulfur, and it is often used as an additive to ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel to aid with lubrication, as the sulfur compounds in petrodiesel provide much of the lubricity. The power output of biodiesel depends on its blend, quality, and load conditions under which the fuel is burnt. The thermal efficiency for example of B100 as compared to B20 will vary due to the differing energy content of the various blends. Thermal efficiency of a fuel is based in part on fuel characteristics such as: viscosity, specific density, and flash point; these characteristics will change as the blends as well as the quality of biodiesel varies. The American Society for Testing and Materials has set standards in order to judge the quality of a given fuel sample. One study found that the brake thermal efficiency of B40 was superior to traditional petroleum counterpart at higher compression ratios (this higher brake thermal efficiency was recorded at compression ratios of 21:1). It was noted that, as the compression ratios increased, the efficiency of all fuel types – as well",-2.6996441888809204

Diversity consistently measures higher in the tropics and in other localized regions such as the Cape Floristic Region and lower in polar regions generally.

Indeed, the cultivation of plants may be viewed as the earliest biotechnological enterprise. Agriculture has been theorized to have become the dominant way of producing food since the Neolithic Revolution. Through early biotechnology, the earliest farmers selected and bred the best-suited crops, having the highest yields, to produce enough food to support a growing population. As crops and fields became increasingly large and difficult to maintain, it was discovered that specific organisms and their by-products could effectively fertilize, restore nitrogen, and control pests. Throughout the history of agriculture, farmers have inadvertently altered the genetics of their crops through introducing them to new environments and breeding them with other plants — one of the first forms of biotechnology.

Its origin is in physics, acoustics, and radio systems engineering, where it had been used with a meaning similar to ""wideband"", or in the context of audio noise reduction systems, where it indicated a single-band rather than a multiple-audio-band system design of the compander. Later, with the advent of digital telecommunications, the term was mainly used for transmission over multiple channels. Whereas a passband signal is also modulated so that it occupies higher frequencies (compared to a baseband signal which is bound to the lowest end of the spectrum, see line coding), it is still occupying a single channel. The key difference is that what is typically considered a broadband signal in this sense is a signal that occupies multiple (non-masking,",-2.3539032196998595
471,"orthogonal) passbands, thus allowing for much higher throughput over a single medium but with additional complexity in the transmitter/receiver circuitry. The term became popularized through the 1990s as a marketing term for Internet access that was faster than dialup access, which was limited to a maximum bandwidth of 56 kbit/s. This meaning is only distantly related to its original technical meaning. Since 1999, broadband has been a factor in public policy. In that year, at the World Trade Organization Biannual Conference called “Financial Solutions to Digital Divide” in Seattle, the term “Meaningful Broadband” was introduced to the world leaders leading to the activation of a movement to close digital divide. Fundamental aspects of this movement is to suggest that the equitable distribution of broadband is a fundamental human right. In telecommunications, a broadband signalling method is one that handles a wide band of frequencies. ""Broadband"" is a relative term, understood according to its context. The wider (or broader) the bandwidth of a channel, the greater the data-carrying capacity, given the same channel quality. In radio, for example, a very narrow band will carry Morse code, a broader band will carry speech, and a",-2.490499227046967
472,"a low-VHF antenna is ""narrowband"" since it receives only 1 to 5 channels. The U.S. federal standard FS-1037C defines ""broadband"" as a synonym for wideband. ""Broadband"" in analog video distribution is traditionally used to refer to systems such as cable television, where the individual channels are modulated on carriers at fixed frequencies. In this context, baseband is the term's antonym, referring to a single channel of analog video, typically in composite form with separate baseband audio. The act of demodulating converts broadband video to baseband video. Fiber optic allows the signal to be transmitted farther without being repeated. Cable companies use a hybrid system using fiber to transmit the signal to neighborhoods and then changes the signal from light to radio frequency to be transmitted over coaxial cable to homes. Doing so reduces the use of having multiple head ends. A head end gathers all the information from the local cable networks and movie channels and then feeds the information into the system. However, ""broadband video"" in the context of streaming Internet video has come to mean video files that have bit-rates high enough to require broadband Internet access for viewing. ""Broadband video""",-2.325292823314667
473,"to transmit one type of signal using a medium's full bandwidth using its baseband (from zero through the highest frequency needed). Most versions of the popular Ethernet family are given names such as the original 1980s 10BASE5 to indicate this. Networks that use cable modems on standard cable television infrastructure are called broadband to indicate the wide range of frequencies that can include multiple data users as well as traditional television channels on the same cable. Broadband systems usually use a different radio frequency modulated by the data signal for each band. The total bandwidth of the medium is larger than the bandwidth of any channel. The 10BROAD36 broadband variant of Ethernet was standardized by 1985, but was not commercially successful. The DOCSIS standard became available to consumers in the late 1990s, to provide Internet access to cable television residential customers. Matters were further confused by the fact that the 10PASS-TS standard for Ethernet ratified in 2008 used DSL technology, and both cable and DSL modems often have Ethernet connectors on them.

Similar situations have occurred in television production (""The Cosby Show is recorded in front of a live television studio audience"") and news broadcasting. A broadcast may be distributed through several physical means. If coming directly from the radio studio at a single station or television station, it is simply sent through the studio/transmitter link to the transmitter and hence from the television antenna located on the radio masts and towers out to the world.

506,"A chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms, ions or molecules that enables the formation of chemical compounds. The bond may result from the electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged ions as in ionic bonds or through the sharing of electrons as in covalent bonds. The strength of chemical bonds varies considerably; there are ""strong bonds"" or ""primary bonds"" such as covalent, ionic and metallic bonds, and ""weak bonds"" or ""secondary bonds"" such as dipole–dipole interactions, the London dispersion force and hydrogen bonding. Since opposite charges attract via a simple electromagnetic force, the negatively charged electrons that are orbiting the nucleus and the positively charged protons in the nucleus attract each other. An electron positioned between two nuclei will be attracted to both of them, and the nuclei will be attracted toward electrons in this position. This attraction constitutes the chemical bond. Due to the matter wave nature of electrons and their smaller mass, they must occupy a much larger amount of volume compared with the nuclei, and this volume occupied by the electrons keeps the atomic nuclei in a bond relatively far apart, as compared with the size of the nuclei themselves.

More sophisticated theories are valence bond theory, which includes orbital hybridization and resonance, and molecular orbital theory which includes linear combination of atomic orbitals and ligand field theory. Electrostatics are used to describe bond polarities and the effects they have on chemical substances. A chemical bond is an attraction between atoms. This attraction may be seen as the result of different behaviors of the outermost or valence electrons of atoms.

The detection system, which consists of a sensor set, is the ""reactive"" part of the instrument.

The ancient Jewish Babylonian uranography pictured a flat Earth with a dome-shaped, rigid canopy called the firmament placed over it (רקיע- rāqîa'). However, the Greek astronomer and mathematician Aristarchus of Samos (c. 310 – c. 230 BC) developed a heliocentric model placing all of the then-known planets in their correct order around the Sun.

The scientist who led the research said that, if emissions of greenhouse gases are not reduced, the planet will be at least 4C warmer by 2100. This is twice the level the world’s governments consider to be dangerous. The research shows that fewer clouds form as the planet warms. This means that less sunlight reﬂects back into space and this makes temperatures even higher. The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery in the study of future climate change.
Professor Steven Sherwood, at the University of New South Wales in Australia, who led the research, said that their work was new in two ways. First, it found what controls the cloud changes and, second, it did not accept the lowest estimates of future global warming; it believed the higher, more damaging estimates.
“4C would be catastrophic, not simply dangerous,” Sherwood said. “For example, it would make life difﬁcult, if not impossible, in much of the tropics and it would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet.” And, if the ice sheets melt, sea levels will rise by many metres.
The research helps to show how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions, say scientists who have commented on the study, published in the journal Nature. 
Experts at Japan’s National Institute for Environmental Studies said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was a good one. They also agreed that this showed future climate change would be bigger than people think. To measure the effect of greenhouse gases on the Earth’s climate, scientists estimate what the rise in temperature would be with twice as much CO in the atmosphere as in the pre-industrial age – and this will probably happen within 50 years. For twenty years, those estimates have been from 1.5C to 5C: a wide range. The new research has reduced that range to between 3C and 5C, by studying the biggest cause of uncertainty: clouds.
Researchers use computer climate models to predict future temperatures and it was important to include the way clouds form in those models. When water evaporates from the oceans, the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reﬂect sunlight; or, it may rise just a few miles and fall slowly back down without forming clouds. 
In reality, both things happen and climate models that include the second possibility predict much higher future temperatures than the models that only include the nine-mile-high clouds. “Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models because they are sometimes wrong, and we know that they are not perfect,” said Sherwood. “But we are ﬁnding that the mistakes are being made by the models that predict less warming, not the models that predict more warming.” He added: “Sceptics may also point to the pause in the rise of temperatures since the end of the 20th century, but there is more and more evidence that we cannot see this pause in other measures of the climate system. 
And the pause is almost certainly temporary. ” The world’s average air temperatures have increased quite slowly since a high point in 1998, which the ocean phenomenon El Niño caused. But, greenhouse gases are trapping more and more heat and over 90% disappears into the oceans. Also, a recent study suggested that it may seem there is a “pause”, but this is only because we did not have temperature readings from polar regions, where there is the most warming. Sherwood accepts that his team’s work on the role of clouds does not mean for sure that temperature rises will be in the higher range. He added that a 4C rise in the world’s average temperatures would have a serious effect on the world and the economies of many countries if we do not reduce emissions.",-1.3145719563961031

703,"Humidity is the concentration of water vapor present in the air. Water vapor, the gaseous state of water, is generally invisible to the human eye. Humidity indicates the likelihood for precipitation, dew, or fog to be present. Humidity depends on the temperature and pressure of the system of interest. The same amount of water vapor results in higher humidity in cool air than warm air. A related parameter is the dew point. The amount of water vapor needed to achieve saturation increases as the temperature increases. As the temperature of a parcel of air decreases it will eventually reach the saturation point without adding or losing water mass. The amount of water vapor contained within a parcel of air can vary significantly. For example, a parcel of air near saturation may contain 28g (0.99oz) of water per cubic metre of air at 30°C (86°F), but only 8g (0.28oz) of water per cubic metre of air at 8°C (46°F).

In hot summer weather, it also increases the apparent temperature to humans (and other animals) by hindering the evaporation of perspiration from the skin as the relative humidity rises.

Some examples of zooplankton can be seen in Figure 2. Zooplankton are really important for our ecosystems. Many zooplankton eat phytoplankton and turn this into an energy source.

Also, not everyone with psychosis has consumed cannabis. Cannabis use may only add to existing risk factors, such as changes in the DNA that we inherit from our parents (Figure 1). So how does cannabis affect the brain? To find out, let us take a step back and look at some biological mechanisms of communication between neurons in the brain. Imagine you are on a rollercoaster ride. Different messenger systems are activated during the ride that make you feel excited or scared. These activations also put the eCB system into action and return all systems to normal levels, thus calming you down after the ride. The eCB system also plays a crucial role in the development of the brain . We have already learned that adolescence is a period when the brain matures. The eCB system plays a role in this maturation by assisting the process of pruning. Cannabis use during adolescence interacts with the eCB system and thus can alter brain maturation and function. How exactly does cannabis interfere with brain maturation? Cannabis contains",-1.408423843383789

If cannabis has such harmful effects, why does not everyone who consumes cannabis get psychosis? DNA influences how the eCB system responds to cannabis exposure, making people more or less vulnerable to psychosis. Scientists are constantly working to understand how the eCB system works and how it interacts with DNA or harmful life events. These interactions define a person’s risk of developing psychosis. The adolescent brain is like a new factory where neurons are still trying to improve their way of communicating. A challenge here and there is always welcome, but too many harmful experiences confuse the brain’s messenger systems and may lead to long-lasting communication problems. This confusion paves the way for mental disorders, like psychosis. As cannabis use is a choice we make, it is a risk factor that can be easily avoided. The upside is that good experiences during adolescence have a positive influence on later brain functioning. Adolescence is a period when we can set the stage for later emotional and social well-being. So, just like we put",-1.517035254240036

It typically has a depth of ~ 2,600 meters (8,500ft) and rises about two kilometers above the deepest portion of an ocean basin. This feature is where seafloor spreading takes place along a divergent plate boundary. The rate of seafloor spreading determines the morphology of the crest of the mid-ocean ridge and its width in an ocean basin. The production of new seafloor and oceanic lithosphere results from mantle upwelling in response to plate separation. The melt rises as magma at the linear weakness between the separating plates, and emerges as lava, creating new oceanic crust and lithosphere upon cooling.

850,"Sometimes people make mistakes when they are speaking. For example, someone might say, “Can you hand me the hammer?” when they meant to ask for a screwdriver. Because this mistake is related to the meaning, it is called a semantic error. Sometimes listeners (or readers) notice these errors and sometimes they do not. Language scientists are interested in how people’s brains respond when sentences have semantic errors. To study this, scientists have done experiments using a technique called EEG. These experiments have shown that people’s brains respond differently to different kinds of semantic errors. In particular, there is a certain brain response based on how well the incorrect word fits in with the other words in the sentence. These experiments have shown that our brains often use knowledge about what kinds of words are expected in a sentence to construct meaning from that sentence.

To study how the brain detects and deals with errors, researchers have used caps equipped with sensors that can measure brain activity. One thing researchers have found using this method is that the brain creates a specific kind of brain activity when a person makes a mistake. This activity, called the error-related negativity or ERN, happens almost at the same time that the error is made. It is as if the brain already knows we are making a mistake within fractions of a second, before we are even aware of it. Where in the brain does this ERN come from? How does it help us learn? And how does it change as we develop from children to adults? Making a mistake feels bad.

By expelling Thucydides the Athenian people sent a clear message about the direction of Athenian policy. Similar but more controversial claims have been made about the ostracism of Cimon in 461 BC.

Although ten years of exile would have been difficult for an Athenian to face, it was relatively mild in comparison to the kind of sentences inflicted by courts; when dealing with politicians held to be acting against the interests of the people, Athenian juries could inflict very severe penalties such as death, unpayably large fines, confiscation of property, permanent exile and loss of citizens' rights through atimia. Further, the elite Athenians who suffered ostracism were rich or noble men who had connections or xenoi in the wider Greek world and who, unlike genuine exiles, were able to access their income in Attica from abroad. In Plutarch, following as he does the anti-democratic line common in elite sources, the fact that people might be recalled early appears to be another example of the inconsistency of majoritarianism that was characteristic of Athenian democracy. However, ten years of exile usually resolved whatever had prompted the expulsion. Ostracism was simply a pragmatic measure; the concept of serving out the full sentence did not apply as it",-2.433271358013153

From the handwriting, they appear to have been written by fourteen individuals and bear the name of Themistocles, ostracised before 471 BC and were evidently meant for distribution to voters. This was not necessarily evidence of electoral fraud (being no worse than modern voting instruction cards), but their being dumped in the well may suggest that their creators wished to hide them. If so, these ostraka provide an example of organized groups attempting to influence the outcome of ostracisms. The two-month gap between the first and second phases would have easily allowed for such a campaign. There is another interpretation, however, according to which these ostraka were prepared beforehand by enterprising businessmen who offered them for sale to citizens who could not easily inscribe the desired names for themselves or who simply wished to save time.

The list may not be complete, but there is good reason to believe the Athenians did not feel the need to eject someone in this way every year. The list of known ostracisms runs as follows: Around 12,000 political ostraka have been excavated in the Athenian agora and in the Kerameikos. The second victim, Cleisthenes' nephew Megacles, is named by 4647 of these, but for a second undated ostracism not listed above. The known ostracisms seem to fall into three distinct phases: the 480s BC, mid-century 461–443 BC and finally the years 417–415: this matches fairly well with the clustering of known expulsions, although Themistocles before 471 may count as an exception. This suggests that ostracism fell in and out of fashion. The last known ostracism was that of Hyperbolus in circa 417 BC.

The question was put in the sixth of the ten months used for state business under the democracy (January or February in the modern Gregorian Calendar). If they voted ""yes"", then an ostracism would be held two months later.

The initial stereotactic instrument he conceived used probes and electrodes. The first attempt to supplant the electrodes with radiation was made in the early fifties, with x-rays. The principle of this instrument was to hit the intra-cranial target with narrow beams of radiation from multiple directions.

While the transcription of spontaneous (freely spoken) speech, and speech in high noise environments still remains an unsolved problem, automatic speech recognition systems are getting better at these rapidly. Based on transcribed speech, databases for different levels of fact-checking can be built. Once speech is converted to textual form, other powerful natural language processing and natural language understanding technologies can help curate content. Speaker verification and identification Speaker verification and identification technologies are based on matching of voiceprints to those present in carefully curated voiceprint databases. In speaker verification, the identity of the speaker is given at the outset, and voice matching verifies the authenticity of the claim.

It is regarded as the most extreme and complete form of authoritarianism. In totalitarian states, political power has often been held by autocrats (i.e. dictators or absolute monarchs) who employ all-encompassing campaigns in which propaganda is broadcast by state-controlled mass media. Totalitarian regimes are often characterized by extensive political repression, a complete lack of democracy, widespread personality cultism, absolute control over the economy, massive censorship, mass surveillance, limited freedom of movement (most notably freedom to leave the country) and widespread use of state terrorism. Other aspects of a totalitarian regime include the use of concentration camps, repressive secret police, religious persecution, state religion or state atheism, the common practice of executions, fraudulent elections, possible possession of weapons of mass destruction and a potential for state-sponsored mass murder and genocides.

Critics of the policy have observed that the governments of Greece and Turkey were themselves far from democratic at this time, and neither were facing Soviet subversion in the spring of 1949. Historian Eric Foner writes that the Doctrine ""set a precedent for American assistance to anticommunist regimes throughout the world, no matter how undemocratic, and for the creation of a set of global military alliances directed against the Soviet Union.""

1079,"Temperature rises resulting from unchecked climate change will be at the severe end of those projected, according to a new scientiﬁc study. The scientist leading the research said that, unless emissions of greenhouse gases were cut, the planet would heat up by a minimum of 4C by 2100, twice the level the world’s governments deem dangerous. The research indicates that fewer clouds form as the planet warms, meaning less sunlight is reﬂected back into space, driving temperatures up further still. The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery surrounding future climate change. Professor Steven Sherwood, at the University of New South Wales in Australia, who led the new work, said: “This study breaks new ground twice: ﬁrst, by identifying what is controlling the cloud changes and, second, by strongly discounting the lowest estimates of future global warming in favour of the higher and more damaging estimates.” 
“4C would likely be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous,” Sherwood said. “For example, it would make life difﬁcult, if not impossible, in much of the tropics and would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet”, with sea levels rising by many metres as a result. 
The research is a “big advance” that halves the uncertainty about how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions, according to scientists commenting on the study, published in the journal Nature. Hideo Shiogama and Tomoo Ogura, at Japan’s National Institute for Environmental Studies, said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was “convincing” and agreed this indicated future climate change would be greater than expected. But they said more challenges lay ahead to narrow down further the projections of future temperatures. 
Scientists measure the sensitivity of the Earth’s climate to greenhouse gases by estimating the temperature rise that would be caused by a doubling of CO in the atmosphere compared with pre-industrial levels – as is likely to happen within 50 years, on current trends. For two decades, those estimates have run from 1.5C to 5C: a wide range. The new research narrowed that range to between 3C and 5C, by closely examining the biggest cause of uncertainty: clouds. 
The key was to ensure that the way clouds form in the real world was accurately represented in computer climate models, which are the only tool researchers have to predict future temperatures. When water evaporates from the oceans, the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reﬂect sunlight; or, it may rise just a few miles and drift back down without forming clouds. In reality, both processes occur and climate models encompassing this complexity predicted signiﬁcantly higher future temperatures than those only including the nine-mile-high clouds. 
“Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong and we are the ﬁrst to admit they are not perfect,” said Sherwood. “But what we are ﬁnding is that the mistakes are being made by the models which predict less warming, not those that predict more.” He added: “Sceptics may also point to the ’hiatus’ of temperatures since the end of the 20th century, but there is increasing evidence that this inaptly named hiatus is not seen in other measures of the climate system and is almost certainly temporary.” 
Global average air temperatures have increased relatively slowly since a high point in 1998 caused by the ocean phenomenon El Niño, but observations show that heat is continuing to be trapped in increasing amounts by greenhouse gases, with over 90% disappearing into the oceans. 
Furthermore, a study in November 2013 suggested the “pause” may be largely an illusion resulting from the lack of temperature readings from polar regions, where warming is greatest. Sherwood accepts his team’s work on the role of clouds cannot deﬁnitively rule out that future temperature rises will lie at the lower end of projections. “But,” he said, for that to be the case, “one would need to invoke some new dimension to the problem involving a major missing ingredient for which we currently have no evidence. Such a thing is not out of the question but requires a lot of faith.” He added: “Rises in global average temperatures of at least 4C by 2100 will have profound impacts on the world and the economies of many countries if we don’t urgently start to curb our emissions.”",-1.9046995866298675

In an article he wrote in 1844 he stated: ""That a limit to variation does exist in nature is assumed by most authors, though I am unable to discover a single fact on which this belief is grounded"".153 In The Origin of Species he cited different examples of variations as the most important evidence for his theory. For instance, according to Darwin, animal breeders who mated different varieties of cattle in order to bring about new varieties that produced more milk, were ultimately going to transform them into a different species. Darwin's notion of ""unlimited variation"" is best seen in the following sentence from The Origin of Species: _I can see no difficulty in a race of bears being rendered, by natural selection, more and more aquatic in their habits, with larger and larger mouths, till a creature was produced as monstrous as a whale._ _154_ The reason Darwin cited",-1.888300964832306

1103,"Believe that Mutations —Deteriorations and Alterations in DNA— Can Produce New Species As we've mentioned, Darwin believed that natural selection is the chief mechanism in the process of evolution. But once Mendel's laws of genetic inheritance were accepted, evolutionists saw that natural selection didn't sufficiently explain the origins of life. They therefore added to their evolutionary mechanisms the concept of mutations. This new evolutionist model, known as Neo-Darwinism, proposed that evolution came about through the two-fold operation of natural selection and mutation. However, claiming that mutation can cause species to develop into new ones is no more scientific than the claims for natural selection. Mutations arise from replacements and interruptions that occur due to chemical effects and radiation on the DNA molecule, located in the nucleus of living cells and which contains all the genetic information relevant to an organism.

In fact, when the results of DNA analyses from different species and classes are compared, it is seen that the sequences clearly do not agree with any evolutionist family tree.

But the data obtained show that this thesis is the work of fantasy. The Russian scientist Theodosius Dobzhansky, one of the best-known theoreticians of evolution, once stated that this irregular relationship between living things and their DNA is a great problem that evolution cannot explain: More complex organisms generally have more DNA per cell than do simpler ones, but this rule has conspicuous exceptions.

He said that the species of large genera and the varieties from species with numerous varieties, were more similar than those species from small genera and those varieties from species with fewer varieties.

The pancreas is like a factory that turns sugars into something our bodies can use, and the factory slows down when the sugar or sweetener does not give us much energy.

In 1839, Charles Goodyear invented the vulcanization process, solving many of the problems associated with rubber. Vulcanization is the process of treating rubber with sulfur and heat, to harden it while keeping its elasticity. It prevents rubber from melting in the summer and cracking in the winter. A few years after this important discovery, in 1888, Dunlop invented the air-filled rubber tire, making rubber an extremely important raw material worldwide. Rubber became an essential material for the Industrial Revolution. From 1850 to 1920, businessmen were pushing entrepreneurs and traders to increase the amount of rubber extracted from Amazonian trees. During this period, the Brazilian Amazon was the only source of rubber and they controlled the price, making rubber expensive.

From those seeds, only 1,900 seedlings survived and were sent to Malaysia to start the first rubber plantations in Asia. This marked the beginning of the end for Brazil as the world’s main rubber producer. After 12 years, rubber production in the new plantations in Malaysia were as competitive as the ones in the Amazon and these plantations soon became the world’s main natural rubber supplier (Figure 3). Henry Nicolas Ridley was a scientist who became director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens in 1888.

This section discusses a little of what happens during this process, so that the difference between what the brain does and what is involved when thinking can be made clearer. Instinctive behaviours are transmitted from one generation to the next through gene codings, as has been demonstrated many times. For instance, fruit flies normally wake up with daylight, nap in the afternoon, then fall asleep at dusk. This behaviour is controlled by a gene, the so-called ""period gene."" If this gene is removed from male and female flies which then mate, their descendants sleep at random times. If the gene is then returned to these time-less progeny, they and their offspring will resume regular sleep patterns. The first, tiny part of this instinctive behaviour started as the result of a mutation1 eons ago that caused one fly to sleep during the dark, with the concomitant reduced danger of being eaten compared to flies that were sleeping",-1.4876752519607543

The variations in hues and patterns on their wings are not just for show but perform crucial communication functions. The patterns on the wings can help protect butterflies from predators through camouflage, or warn predators that the butterfly’s body is toxic, or help attract potential mates. A major feature of these wing canvases is that they have two sides and they can contain different messages on each side. In general, butterflies use the upper surfaces of their wings to seduce the opposite sex, whereas they use the lower surfaces to hide from view or to communicate to their predators that eating them would be toxic. We have identified a gene that is responsible for creating the upper surface “seductive message” patterns.

As discussed, these muscles serve to massage the wall of the intestines to move matter through your intestines. When the loss of neurons in the intestinal muscles occurs the intestinal muscles lose tone. They lose the ability to properly move matter through the intestines. The intestines increase in diameter, and the intestinal wall becomes thicker; which can lead to a variety of problems. More water is drawn out of the digesting food, which makes the stool harder.

His forces , almost all Highlanders , defeated William 's forces at the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689 , but they took heavy losses and Dundee was slain in the fighting . Without his leadership the Jacobite army was soon defeated at the Battle of Dunkeld , by a newly raised government regiment of Cameronians . The last land forces of the Jacobites were defeated at the Battle of <unk> in Strathspey on 1 May 1690 and Gordon surrendered Edinburgh Castle on 17 June .

In these cases, yes, the disease-causing microbes transmitted by ticks can represent a health danger. Like any rule, there are some exceptions.

Ash can travel down the slopes of a volcano in huge clouds, called pyroclastic flows, for tens of kilometers. Pyroclastic flows are very hot and fast mixtures of volcanic gas, ash, and blocks (volcanic rock >64 mm diameter) that travel down the volcano, destroying everything in their paths.

When you see emotional expressions of similar strength often enough in your own culture, this influences the way you read those emotions from facial expressions. So, what if you want to figure out what someone is feeling. Which part of the face gives you your biggest clue? The answer to this question comes from experiments that used eye trackers. An eye tracker is a special device that monitors eye movements and, therefore, can tell scientists exactly where a person is looking. Eye trackers allow scientists to study what regions of the face people pay most attention to (for example, the eyes or the mouth) when they are trying to understand others’ emotions.

Yes, because the brain system specializing in understanding faces is similar across cultures, so we all can recognize basic emotions, such as happiness or sadness, when looking at other faces. No, because culture influences how we behave and how we think, which means it also influences the rules we learn as children that tell us when and how to show our emotions.

TB can affect people of all ages, from kids to the elderly, and in infected people, it often spreads to other organs, in addition to the lungs and can even spread throughout the body. Today, the most common way to diagnose TB is by staining the bacteria present in sputum (coughed up mucus) samples, using a chemical that will color those bacterial cells. However, in cases where the bacteria are located outside the lungs, this strategy is not effective. Furthermore, in some cases where coughed up mucus can be obtained, it could contain too few bacteria to easily detect them.

This is because the interaction of some of these chemicals with each other or with other things in the environment (for example pesticides, radiation, and viruses) can cause an increase in their harmful impact on DNA. In fact, it has been shown in experiments that the presence of more than one chemical increases their harmful impact . It is known that, in certain cases, the presence of two chemicals together can have more severe effects than the effects of each chemical alone. In toxicology, this phenomenon is called “synergism.” Certain genetic diseases or specific lifestyle factors (for example smoking, eating junk food, or eating too much, etc.) have the potential to further increase the risk of such chemicals.

These three parts are called the dendrites, the axon, and the nerve ending (Figure 1). The dendrites receive information from the sensor or other neurons. This information then moves to the axon, which travels to or from the spinal cord. The action potential travels from the nerve endings at one end of the neuron to the next neuron. Many reflexes start at the muscle or skin and go to the spinal cord. When the action potential reaches the nerve ending, the signal is transferred to another neuron, such as an interneuron or motor neuron. The action potential then travels outside the spinal cord to a muscle. It doesn’t matter whether the neuron is a sensory neuron, an interneuron, or a motor neuron—the action potential travels from the dendrites to the axon to the nerve endings.",-1.7215140902996064

From the cell body, long axons (axe-ons) and dendrites branch out to send and receive messages to and from other cells. At the end of the axon, there are structures called terminal boutons, which look like small bumps. The terminal boutons contact dendrites of other neurons to form specialized connections called synapses (sin-ap-sez). When neurons talk to each other, they send electrical or chemical messages that can cause the next neuron to fire an action potential (signal) down its axon. In this way, the signal can be sent along a whole chain of neurons. To speed up the signaling, many neurons are insulated by fatty layers called myelin, similar to the way a wire is insulated. Within your brain, your neurons help you learn to read, write, ride a bicycle, form memories, and even to have emotions.

1564,"Bacteria live with each other in an organized network called a biofilm. The biofilm allows the bacteria to communicate with each other and transfer nutrients and signals from one bacterium to another. This communication provides the bacteria with new properties that allow them to survive, even when they are exposed to harmful compounds that usually kill them (for example, antibiotics). These persistent bacteria can now cause what are called hospital-acquired infections because patients often get them while in a healthcare facility, like a hospital. Hospital-acquired infections obviously endanger the health of patients and may lead to death. So, it is important to find solutions that prevent bacteria from forming biofilms. My research group designed and synthesized a compound that forms a coating on different materials and does not allow bacteria to form biofilm. This compound may be useful in the future as a coating for medical devices, water desalination facilities, and food preparation surfaces. Bacteria are small organisms that cannot be seen with the naked eye. To detect them, one must use a microscope.

Just like these chefs, some bacterial species seek out organic matter and transform it into something that another organism can eat. We can imagine the bacteria doing similar activities on a particle. Some bacteria are picky and eat only very specific nutrients. Other bacteria cannot break down the more complex food. Instead, they have to find simple, ready-to-eat food from the river water. Other bacteria are not so fussy and will consume anything they can get ahold of. After consuming organic matter, the bacteria (and maybe even the particle where they live!) are often eaten by larger, but still microscopic, organisms. We know that bacteria are important to a habitat, but they are hard to see with our naked eyes. To understand what the bacteria can do, our team studied the genes of these bacteria. We found that particle-attached bacteria also appear to have a larger number of genes, or instructions for living, compared with free-living bacteria.

Furthermore, there were thousands of Japanese living in the United States who had served in the Japanese military, then entered the U.S. before the war, and were regarded as a grave threat to U.S. security. By mid-1941 the Japanese had recruited ethnic Japanese living in the U.S. to set up an espionage network in Hawaii and along the West Coast. Some were also indoctrinated in school.

These brain regions are shown in red in the top row of Figure 2. Additionally, a computer could accurately predict whether a particular song was well-known, recently known, or unknown just by analyzing the patterns of brain activity in these regions. Taken together, the results of this study reveal a “musical memory area” (MMA) that enables us to remember our favorite songs. Importantly, this MMA is separate from the hippocampus and the temporal lobe that we know are necessary for long-term memory function. Now that we have identified the MMA, let us take a closer look at what happens in the brains of people who have AD. AD is the most common form of dementia, and it most frequently afflicts people close to your grandparents’ age. People who suffer from AD start to lose their memories of who they are, where they have been, and what they have done. In later",-1.7740080082416534

Yet, despite profound memory loss and even a loss of knowledge about who they are, individuals with dementia often show a remarkable memory for music (, Chapter 29). Their musical memories somehow survive the widespread brain damage, even when other long-term memories do not. Might musical memories be processed somewhere else in the brain, in an area separate from the network of regions involved in long-term memory? To answer this question, researchers recorded the brain responses of 32 healthy young adults as they listened to carefully pre-selected snippets of well-known, recently known, and completely unknown pieces of music . The well-known pieces were selected from songs that were in the Top 10 between 1977 and 2007, nursery rhymes, and oldies, while the unknown songs were selected by looking at people’s listening habits and choices on Amazon and Pandora. An hour before the participants’ brains were scanned, they heard half of the songs in the unknown group twice, so that these songs would make up the “recently known” group.

What, then, is so special about the ability of these people to remember music, even when they cannot remember just about anything else? In this article, we will show you where musical memories may be represented in the brain and how they can survive while other memories are lost. In order to form and retrieve long-term memories (i.e., pieces of personal experiences and knowledge), multiple regions of the brain work together to form a coordinated network that transmits information from one brain region to another. For instance, when you remember what something you saw earlier that day looked like, you are using your occipital lobe, which is involved in vision. When you remember what you were thinking about earlier, or wonder how something that happened may have instead happened differently, you are using your frontal lobe (which is important for thinking). When you remember other moments in time, such as your own past (or when you think about your own future), you use multiple brain regions, including both the temporal",-1.134166564941406

More white matter is seen in the connections between temporal (sensory) and frontal (cognitive) cortex, and in the corpus callosum, the thick axonal bridge that connects the left and right halves of the brain. These structural changes may help explain the increase in neural activity that functional scans have detected in musicians (compared to non-musicians) as they listen to and distinguish between the various sound elements of music and speech . Having more neurons in – and better connections between – these brain regions allows musicians to more efficiently and accurately process information from their senses and send motor commands to their muscles. Musicians are better at noticing small differences in the timing and tonal quality (frequency spectrum) of both music and speech sounds. They are also better at understanding speech in noisy settings, such as a room full of people talking and laughing.

In the Building Blocks of Cognition Lab at the University of California at Berkeley, we wanted to investigate whether a training program specifically designed to exercise the reasoning parts of the brain would improve reasoning.

A series of privately owned and controlled Federal Reserve Banks would be established in various regions of the country. All Federal Reserve System member banks would be required to purchase non-transferable stock in their regional Federal Reserve Bank (so they had a stake in the entire system) and also set aside a portion of their bank reserves with that regional bank. The Federal Reserve stock held by the member banks would pay a 6% annual dividend. The Federal Reserve Banks would make short-term discounted loans, as needed, to member banks in their region to ensure that no member bank ever ran short of money to service their customers.

To begin with, we need to understand that the concepts of evil, and sin, as they are found in the Bible, were only required because of the hatred, violence and injustice that kept developing on earth. And, this becomes clear when the Hebrew, and Greeks words for evil, and sin, are analysed. For instance, the Hebrew root word for sin is ""chata"" (khaw-taw'), which means ""to miss."" It also means ""the harm that has been done."" So, if the goal is love, compassion, or caring, then harming others would definitely be the opposite of this goal, therefore it would ""miss"" this goal. The Greek word for sin is ""hamartano"" (ham-ar-tan'-o), which means ""to miss the mark."" If the mark is to care, be compassionate, or love, then harming others would certainly be missing this mark.

It was the only remedy, as extreme and unfathomable as it was, for this devastating condition. What is almost incomprehensible to me is that many Christians do not want to believe that sin is an important concern in God's dealing with humanity.

The collective unconscious is like a sea of beliefs, thoughts and behaviours that stretch right back in time to the beginning of man and along the development of man, our ancestors. All this information has been passed on to us today in the form of genetics, dreams and the unconscious. The unconscious is the sea of this knowledge we all have. In other words the way we think and behave is still influenced by our very first ancestors, so that even now, we might believe that attacking the enemy when threatened is the best solution because this is what our ancestors did. On an individual level the narcissist, and the victim, also have developed from patterns of upbringing passed on from thousands of years ago!!! Science is now agreeing, and a new scientific study called epigenetics has begun to explore the effects of ancestors on human genes.

It is something of an ugly stepchild within the larger family of our personality. Little of that has anything to do with the way the word is used here. Here, when we talk about the unconscious, it means anything that we are not focused on in the present moment, but that we could focus on if we so chose. Think of it as like being in a dark room wearing a miner's helmet with a built-in flashlight. You can only see clearly that which the light shines on. By moving your head you can shine the light on anything in the room, but it can only illuminate one thing at a time. Our conscious awareness performs much the same role in our mental experience as the flashlight does in a dark room.

Without the experience of conscious reality we are not fully aware of our existence, and without this awareness, the activity of the unconscious mind lacks control. Thus, our active, current consciousness is actual existence, new again in each instant yet totally dependent on what we were before, and able to anticipate the future only in terms of the past. The mind of a human is much more than just a wave of consciousness cresting over the ocean of our being. Beneath the surface of our thoughts lies an unknown frontier more profound than any we have, or may yet explore. Through our consciousness, we have only surface contact with the most complex of organs, the essence of our identity, the brain. Although we know that the brain functions on many levels, we have only the readout of consciousness to inform us of these functions.

The light guarding the Garden of Eden was to block the path to further power for self-centeredness. I, Jesus, allowed evil, as well as the way to overcome it; and in so doing, you become stronger. Accept that the Creation is bigger than your brain, it has enough coherence and meaning for you to move and learn. Evil is present, but it will not last forever. Love and communion last forever. Evil is temporary, evil is not eternal but will be crushed. Some call it annihilation, others the lake of fire,",-1.5998347699642181

Yet, when beauty manifests itself through another human form, it can trigger a fear response. Rather than seeing the truth, that who we are animates every form, we categorize the person as other, believing that we are inadequate and lacking in comparison. Assuming that relationship and happiness are finite resources, reserved for the genetically fortunate few and because we don't think we measure up, we hang our heads, slink away, and resign ourselves to a fate of living pedestrian, uneventful lives. The other underlying assumption in the ego's hypothesis is that other people value only our outer appearance. Many of us fantasize about walking into a room and all eyes instantly land on us. It's true that people can be temporarily taken in by outer beauty and perhaps for some, being with someone whose outer appearance",-1.2108311963081362

One innovation brought about by the adoption of trench warfare was the barrage — a term first used in the battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915 . Trench warfare had created the need for indirect fire , with the use of observers , more sophisticated artillery fire plans , and an increasingly scientific approach to gunnery , where artillerymen had to use increasingly complicated calculations to lay the guns . Individual guns were aimed so that their fall of shot was coordinated with others to form a pattern ; in the case of a barrage , the pattern was a line .  ",-1.7583428478240966

There was no way to explain to herself the abuse she'd suffered, and certainly no-one she could possibly talk about it with, so she had crushed her pain into a ball and swallowed it. Now every day she chewed upon it as cud, looking for some way to digest it, and the only answer that presented itself was revenge.

They reason that if interest rates were lower, more people would be able to borrow money to purchase homes, household goods, clothes, and automobiles, etc. The lower interest rates would produce a surge in economic activity as producers respond to the increased demands for goods and services.

When Corsica declared formal secession from France and requested the protection of the British government Napoleon and his commitment to the French Revolution came into conflict with Paoli, who had decided to sabotage the Corsican contribution to the Expédition de Sardaigne, by preventing a French assault on the Sardinian island of La Maddalena. Bonaparte and his family were compelled to flee to Toulon on the French mainland in June 1793 because of the split with Paoli. Although he was born ""Napoleone di Buonaparte"", it was after this that Napoleon began styling himself ""Napoléon Bonaparte"" but his family did not drop the name Buonaparte until 1796. The first known record of him signing his name as Bonaparte was at the age of 27 (in 1796). In July 1793, Bonaparte published a pro-republican pamphlet entitled Le souper de Beaucaire (Supper at Beaucaire) which gained him the support of Augustin Robespierre, younger brother of the Revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre.

2222," Undoubtedly by 1793 the armies of the French Republic were in a state of disruption ; experienced soldiers of the Ancien Régime fought side by side with raw volunteers , urged on by revolutionary fervor from the special representatives , agents of the legislature sent to insure cooperation among the military . Many of the old officer class had emigrated , and the cavalry in particular suffered from their departure . The artillery arm , considered by the old nobility to be an inferior assignment , was less affected by emigration , and survived intact . The problems would become even more acute following the introduction of mass conscription , the levée en <unk> , in 1793 . French commanders walked a fine line between the security of the frontier and clamor for victory ( which would protect the regime in Paris ) on the one hand , and the desperate condition of the army on the other , while they themselves were constantly under suspicion from the representatives of the new regime .

Furthermore , it was an army entirely dependent for support upon the countryside . After April 1796 , pay was made in metallic value , but pay was still in arrears . Throughout the spring and early summer , the unpaid French army was in almost constant mutiny : in May 1796 , in the border town of Zweibrücken , the 74th revolted . In June , the 17th was insubordinate ( frequently ) and in the 84th , two companies rebelled .

The magnificent Cathedral while still standing tall and proud was badly damaged. It made us think about the futility of war and the massive losses with no gains for the day to day people. That evening we decided to have dinner at the hotel, both ordering roast pork. When the meal arrived we both thought it was strange that the desert arrived with the main meal. The pork was delicious and then we tucked into the desert. It tasted awful and when I asked the waiter about it I was told that it wasn't desert, it was the apple sauce to go with the pork.

"" Wollstonecraft emphasizes the benefits of hard work , self @-@ discipline , frugality , and morality , values she contrasts with the "" vices of the rich "" , such as "" insincerity "" and the "" want of natural affections "" . She endorses a commercial society that would help individuals discover their own potential as well as force them to realize their civic responsibilities .

In so doing , she gives greater value to the imagination than she had in previous works . As in her previous writings , she champions the liberation and education of women .

Titanic had been designed to stay afloat with four of her forward compartments flooded but not more , and the crew soon realised that the ship would sink . They used distress flares and radio ( wireless ) messages to attract help as the passengers were put into lifeboats . In accordance with existing practice , Titanic 's lifeboat system was designed to ferry passengers to nearby rescue vessels , not to hold everyone on board simultaneously . So with the ship sinking fast and help still hours away , there was no safe refuge for many of the passengers and crew .

Clouds encircled those snowcapped mountains like glowing white halos. The area appeared pristine and wild. In fact, there were no signs of anyone anywhere. The landmarks were all there, the mountains, the valley, the streams, but where there was once a paved road, nothing but a green boggy meadow. Where houses once speckled the distant hills lining the small valley to the west, nothing but open grass and sage gleaned in the sun. Even Interstate 25 which met Interstate 90 up there on that hill to the northwest was nothing but a sage knoll. His mind raced then wandered, always coming back to the same question, ""Where am I?""

Its arms were longer, far too long, stick-like in their thinness ending in viciously hooked talons. The figure appeared bloodless, drained, blue-tinged, and more dead than alive.

In short, in attempting to improve a world that was already free of war and thus a sort of paradise, the man would force this shade of humanity through a long, painful transformation that would only begin with the end of their world.

Nor was that mere happenstance, it had been forbidden by principle - a principle called the Laissez-Faire imperative, a principle he had jokingly referred to as the Prime Directive, a principle designed to avoid interference with or contamination of something that was both extremely rare and intrinsically valuable. Valuable not because of what it meant or what use could be found for it. Valuable simply in itself. It was a moral code imposed over the human will by humanity's own successors.

Finally, in 1760, he became vicar of the Anglican Church at Madeley, which position he held until his death. The first ten years at Madeley were spent in preaching, visiting among his people, and in a profound study of theology and religious works of all kinds. It was just the preparation Fletcher needed to make him the powerful defender of Methodism. John Wesley opposed his settling down at Madeley, but later probably saw the wisdom of it. After 1765, Methodist Societies were formed in the neighborhood of Madeley, and Fletcher frequently preached for them. Enormous crowds flocked to hear him, and the buildings would seldom contain the people. In 1765 he visited Bath and Bristol, preaching in the large meeting houses belonging to the Countess of Huntington. She",-1.9639644014835358

Which is why of course Nick did not write what I have posted on my first slide. What he posted, and what will be instantly recognisable to all of you, is the following: My rough thesis is that when children really enjoy a story they go on thinking about it afterwards, often making up extra bits en route. Thus all those letters to authors asking them about what happened after a story officially came to an end. By the same token, children hate unfinished stories of the shaggy dog type that have been used to tease the younger reader probably ever since speech began. My conclusion will be that children see life very much in terms of a series of stories, which means that an unfinished story is particularly hard for them to accept.

He started to compose. He wrote six sinfonias which were called after the first six months of the year (in the Czech language the months have names which are about the seasons).,-1.0212592548131942
2522,"It was difficult to find enough time to compose because he was a teacher. A man called Schober persuaded Schubert to give up teaching so that he could spend all his time composing. Soon he had become well known in all the drawing-rooms in Vienna where he met famous people, many of them musicians. These meetings were called “Schubertiads” because they played and sang his music. He wrote so many wonderful pieces that it seems strange that the music publishers did not want to publish them. They were only interested in publishing works written by performers, but were not very interested in people like Schubert who just composed. For a time he became music teacher for the two princesses of Count Johann Esterházy, but then he returned to Vienna to live with the Schober family. During the last few years of his life Schubert was ill. He had to leave the Schober’s house and find his own rooms. He was often desperately poor and composed in bed to keep warm.",-0.3870164728164673

There was no moonlight that night, with the stars and the fall moon hidden by the dense cloud cover. Suddenly, a flash of light burst across the peaks of the Clent Hills.

[73] While made in 1989, this observation by Euben is indeed easily relatable to the rational choice models discussed earlier which are currently the most popular way to theorise corruption. Thus, Euben shows not only how corruption is shaped in social processes which the positivist research approach is not able to grasp, but he also argues that this approach itself contributes to the shaping of conceptions of corruption in very particular ways. These accounts serve as illustrations of the ways in which meanings of corruption have been shaped historically, and how the concept is imbued with or emptied of particular values over time.

[49] Thus, the move away from positivism allows corruption to be analysed as a normative concept that can mean different things to different people in different social contexts and the meaning of which is shaped through social processes characterised by a constant interplay of material and ideational structures. Its construction through these processes is closely interrelated with that of manifold other social norms and ideals as well as social practices which are again closely linked to more general assumptions about what there is in the world, how we can understand it and how we should deal with it. ### Corruption as the 'subversion of the naturally sound constitution of society' While this thesis is not the first",-3.015419116020203

In this process new fractures and fissures are created in the adjacent rock by injecting fluids under high pressure into cracks. This opens up areas in the rock formations that have trapped petroleum products that were otherwise inaccessible. This procedure has been used to reopen capped wells for further production, increased production from existing working wells and reached petroleum products at greater depth and horizontal distance from wells.

Consequently , phenotypic variations observed in the field — such as size , shape , and cap color — may be influenced by differing conditions of light color and intensity . For example , specimens grown in the laboratory under green light had fruit bodies with short , straight stems and pale orange , large caps with well @-@ developed ridges and pits , an appearance similar to specimens found in the field that were growing under a canopy of green leaves .

Each body carries the fiery energy within itself, and during extraordinary intensification this energy is kindled and the density seems to disappear. There are two reasons why such a phenomenon occurs so rarely--the quality of the intensification, and the qualifications of the observer. It is difficult to observe such phenomena while in the physical body because the heart can be overstrained, and only one or two observations at long intervals may be permitted. Therefore, contacts with certain spheres must be maintained with caution. Most people miss this point, and do not appreciate the need for such precautions. Even erudite people can fail to understand the immutability of the law, but every violation is punished accordingly and without exception.

In this process new fractures and fissures are created in the adjacent rock by injecting fluids under high pressure into cracks.

But, offshore drilling evolved fitfully 'til after WW-II. Then we took it up in earnest. First, fixed platforms sat on the sea bottom. The tallest of these eventually reached a depth of 1700 feet. Then compliant towers, and floating platforms anchored to the bottom with tensioned cables. They got even deeper....""

At first the production of dyes based on aniline was critical. Germany's political disunity—with three dozen states—and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s. However, by the 1840s, trunk lines linked the major cities; each German state was responsible for the lines within its own borders. Lacking a technological base at first, the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 1890, their engineering was inferior to Britain's.

Robert Weldon had tried to build one on the Somersetshire Coal Canal in 1798 , which was replaced by an inclined plane after persistent failures . One was built at Ruabon on the Ellesmere Canal in 1796 , but was replaced as it was not robust enough for regular use . James Fussell built one on the abortive Dorset and Somerset Canal , but the works were abandoned before it was ever used regularly . The lift at Tardebigge on the Worcester and Birmingham Canal was replaced by locks in 1815 as it was "" too complex and delicate "" , according to Rennie . Finally , another lift at Camden Town on the Regent 's Canal was replaced by locks in 1815 because it could not be made to work .  ",-2.0578765583038328

Since then, the much quicker and cheaper L.D. process, or variations of it, using basic oxygen vessels, has increasingly replaced the open hearth process to the extent that not a single open hearth steel melting shop has, to my knowledge, been built anywhere in the world in recent years. Unfortunately, we cannot afford at present to convert our steel melting shops to any of these modern oxygen processes. 9. On the iron making side, although blast furnaces continue throughout the world to provide the predominant if not the sole means of producing iron, and their basic design has remained largely unchanged, they have grown to an incredible extent in size and efficiency as may be seen from the fact that whereas our latest furnace, which, built in the",-2.0573660755157475

Humans now add as much or more industrially fixed nitrogen (~150 billion kilograms) to the environment each year, than is naturally fixed . One hundred and fifty billion kilograms (~330 billion pounds) of anything is hard to imagine, but this is equal to the weight of ~24 million fully grown adult elephants! As mentioned, most nitrogen on Earth is present as nitrogen gas, which is unusable for plants and animals. In the early 1900’s, scientists discovered how to transform nitrogen gas from the atmosphere into nitrogen-containing compounds that could be used to fertilize soils (Figure 1). This industrial fixation is called the Haber-Bosch process. Almost all the nitrogen in industrial fertilizers is fixed through the Haber-Bosch process. This industrial fixation of nitrogen is performed in chemical laboratories and large factories all over the world. The Haber-Bosch process requires that nitrogen gas be mixed with hydrogen gas (H2) and put under enormous pressure (200 times atmospheric pressure).

While plastic parts could be simply and cheaply produced by a number of injection molders using standard compounds, ceramic parts were made by job-shops, each employing different methods and using its own batch formulations. Drawing a parallel from the plastics industry, he thought of a future where ceramics too could be made in a high-volume, automated environment using injection molding. Injection molding was only part of Ballard's vision. He imagined an entire business for AlliedSignal where the latter would act as a supplier of ceramic molding compounds to a large number of independent molders; the technology could be further leveraged by supplying these molders with a service consisting of automated parts prototyping and mold design and fabrication.

However, he should not be limited by or take pride in his limited knowledge and art. Most people, instead of making their learning and knowledge a ladder for the ascent of their intellect in order to raise themselves to a higher level, remain stationary and imprisoned within the four walls of concepts and terms. Man's original nature, once it senses danger, rushes to his aid. When a person is pressed by hardship and overwhelming problems, when material factors turn their back on him, when he has no access to any of the resources of life and is drowning like a straw in a maelstrom of vicissitudes and death is but one step away—then an inward motive guides him instinctively to a non-material source of support.

2946,"currents. A practical example is thermal hydraulics. This can be described by the formula: where On a microscopic scale, heat conduction occurs as hot, rapidly moving or vibrating atoms and molecules interact with neighboring atoms and molecules, transferring some of their energy (heat) to these neighboring particles. In other words, heat is transferred by conduction when adjacent atoms vibrate against one another, or as electrons move from one atom to another. Conduction is the most significant means of heat transfer within a solid or between solid objects in thermal contact. Fluids—especially gases—are less conductive. Thermal contact conductance is the study of heat conduction between solid bodies in contact. The process of heat transfer from one place to another place without the movement of particles is called conduction, such as when placing a hand on a cold glass of water—heat is conducted from the warm skin to the cold glass, but if the hand is held a few inches from the glass, little conduction would occur",-2.377344818115234
2947,"Heinrich Hertz. Hertz started his investigations with electrical oscillations of spark discharges. It was easy enough to produce spark discharges using induction coils but by adding capacitors in the circuit, he obtained a more pronounced effect. To this circuit he connected a secondary circuit, which too had a small gap in the circuit path. What happened next was almost magical. When the primary circuit sparked, the secondary circuit sparked too. He then disconnected the secondary circuit completely from the primary. Even without any physical wire connection, the effect remained unchanged. By adjusting the wire length of the secondary circuit, which was nothing more than passive elements of inductors and capacitors, he could make the secondary circuit spark in resonance with the primary circuit. Sparking in the primary circuit had generated electromagnetic waves that travelled to the secondary circuit a few metres away. Induction effect on the secondary circuit allowed it to spark faintly. Miraculously, Hertz had found a method to prove that electromagnetic waves do exist. He could detect them even if he couldn't see them.

With more than ninety thousand dead from this experiment, it was considered to be a huge success. These villagers had been growing rice for over three thousand years. It was their cultural identity.

In a startling comment this report outlined that only about 43% of the cereal produced is available for use by humans. This is presumably due to harvest and post-harvest loss during distribution, use of these for animal feed and bio-fuel production.

To Darwin , natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design , and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering , such as the ichneumon wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its eggs . He still viewed organisms as perfectly adapted , and On the Origin of Species reflects theological views . Though he thought of religion as a tribal survival strategy , Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of God as an ultimate lawgiver . He was increasingly troubled by the problem of evil .

We can no longer argue that , for instance , the beautiful hinge of a bivalve shell must have been made by an intelligent being , like the hinge of a door by man .

3019,"in particular, many scientists from such different fields as biology, biochemistry and paleontology recognize the invalidity of Darwinism and employ the concept of intelligent design to account for the origin of life. This ""intelligent design"" is a scientific expression of the fact that God created all living things. We have examined the collapse of the theory of evolution and the proofs of creation in great scientific detail in many of our works, and are still continuing to do so. Given the enormous importance of this subject, it will be of great benefit to summarize it here. ## The Scientific Collapse of Darwinism Although this doctrine goes back as far as ancient Greece, the theory of evolution was advanced extensively in the nineteenth century. The most important development that made it the top topic of the world of science was Charles Darwin's the Origin of Species, published in 1859. In this book, he denied that God created different living species on Earth separately, for he claimed that all living beings had a common ancestor and had diversified",-2.114206383228302

The Worldmaker (of course, when the Worldmaker produced the World, He also produced all that is found in that World, including animals) produced the first animal using one set of tools, and he then produced all the other animals using another set of tools. Conclusion The Argument from Design is an argument whose conclusion is meant to be probable; it is not a proof of the existence of God. Let me conclude by saying that the reader should decide for him- or herself how strong the Argument from Design is. Note: The quotations by William Paley that appear in this essay are from his Natural Theology. Chapter 15: A. C. Ewing (1899-1973): The Argument From Design The design argument is very old — it goes all the way back to Saint Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274). However, A. C. Ewing has a modern version of it in his book The Fundamental Questions of Philosophy (1951). Another name for the design argument is the teleological (refers to ends or purposes) argument.

Morris saying "" any living thing gives such strong evidence for design by an intelligent designer that only a willful ignorance of the data ( II Peter 3 : 5 ) could lead one to assign such intricacy to chance . "" Such publications introduced concepts central to intelligent design , including irreducible complexity ( a variant of the watchmaker analogy ) and specified complexity ( closely resembling a fine @-@ tuning argument ) . The United States Supreme Court ruling on Edwards v. Aguillard barred the teaching of "" Creation Science "" in public schools because it breached the separation of church and state , and a group of creationists rebranded Creation Science as "" intelligent design "" which was presented as a scientific theory rather than as a religious argument .

The thuds as they struck thundered in my ears. There was a lot of screaming. A man was struck across the forehead. A flap of bloody skin fell down over his eyes. He was howling that he'd been blinded. A child was hit in the hand. He was sitting on the embankment, his hand held out in front of him, blood dripping.

3154,"Crickets are small, often nocturnal insects. They are usually dark brown or black, so that they blend in with the ground. They have six legs. Four are walking legs and two large back legs are used to make very long jumps. Attached to the head are two long antennae, also known as feelers, used for touching and smelling. Crickets are sometimes confused with grasshoppers because they are similar in size and body shape, but grasshoppers have shorter antennae and are green in color. Crickets are related to grasshoppers. True crickets belong to the Family Gryllidae. They have a broad, somewhat flattened body between 3/8 inch and 1 inch in length. The long, tapered antennae (feelers) usually grow much longer than the body. Most crickets have flat overlapping wings on top of the back. Some species have tiny wings and others are wingless. Females have long, needlelike ovipositors for laying eggs. Both males and females have a flat, round tympanum (hearing organ) in each front",-0.0026632679626345523

Crickets move at night, so they are dark. Katydids like to spend a lot of time on leaves, so they are often leaf-colored, and their wings can look like leaves.

Experts recognize four types of cricket songs: calling, courting, aggressive, and mating. The calling song is fairly loud. It is meant to attract females and repel other males. The very quiet courting song is used when a female is near. Only signals from a male of her kind will cause a female to approach and accept him as a mate. An aggressive song is used when another male is detected. Crickets that live in trees and bushes usually sing only at night. Those that live in weeds generally sing both day and night. House crickets and field crickets make songs both day and night. Females of chirping and singing species have organs on their legs to hear sound. Most camel crickets do not produce sounds, so neither males nor females have hearing organs. Crickets have a variety of habitats. They",-0.17950304826721547

They had an old fashioned farm house, and I loved how big it was. One of the bathrooms was under the main staircase, an afterthought from decades of dependence on outhouses. One year we visited when the temperature hit 101 degrees. They had chickens and an incubator house where eggs were kept under warm lights until chicks were hatched. They had a chicken house where chickens nested to lay eggs, a chicken yard and sometimes a rooster. Once my mother and her sisters gathered at the farm and they killed and prepared fresh chickens. They would kill a chicken by cutting off its head with a hatchet on a block of wood, and one chicken got away and ran around without its head. We weren't supposed to see that.

For the Disciple of reason says (1 An Early text: 7): ""Everyone hath his proper gift from Wisdom; one after this manner, and another after that.""

But this is clearly not the case: since various true thinkers are specially praised for different virtues; e.g. The founder of an early school for reason (Gks. 4), A most ancient and honored scientist for his meekness (Nil.Obs. 3), Job for his patience (Wilh.",-3.156621434688568

As they rode toward the house, the kids ran in to warn their mother. Maria was looking out the door smiling at George and Tammy. Maria started calling for Franz, who walked to the door and looked out to see what all the commotion was about. When he saw George and Tammy, he ran out of the house and greeted them by hugging them both at once. ""Welcome home, my friends,"" he cried.

But Andre de Camp, scion of a wealthy French family that had relocated to Fall River in the summer of 1877, a tall, brooding, and decidedly handsome bachelor of nineteen years, the product of private civilized education, brilliant and concisely intelligent, fastidious in his manly dress, and precise in his manners, held a special place in Lizzie's estimation of the masculine half of humanity. She first glimpsed him at a mid-summer charity event in the church hall of the First Congregational. Standing with his illustrious family—the father wearing proudly a decorated uniform, the mother and sister posed upright with pious concentration—Andre bowed his head towards Lizzie, just once, as if in humble supplication before a higher power.

He left Cashbourne in 1948 to do his National Service and at the end of these two hateful years he gladly took himself off to the Sorbonne where, for the duration of his stay, he cultivated the image of an Englishman abroad, a looking-glass inversion of his previous Gallic masquerade. He may have claimed to deplore the fashionable French philosophy of existentialism as the most unappealing of mental outlooks but there was no question that his soul was imbued with many of its heathen tenets. Its emphasis on the liberty of the human being to invent and reinvent himself free of any God-given constraints suited his personality down to the ground.

During a beheading game, he chopped off his opponents head. The corpse replaced the head and explained that he was Caradoc’s biological father. Humiliated, he took his father and locked him in a tower. While attempting to escape, the wizard made a serpent wrap itself around his son's arm. A witch persuaded Eliaures, who was a magician, to make the snake attach itself to Caradoc's arm, sucking his blood. His friend Cador saved his life by putting his sister Guimer in a vat of milk and Caradoc in a vat of sour wine. This got the snake to cross from one vat to the other, giving Cador the chance to kill it with his sword. The attack caused Caradoc’s arm to “shrivel away”, and he became known as Breifbras (little-arm). Later in life he married Guignier.

Some of these differences the plant or animal may have got from their own ancestors, but some are new and caused by mutations. When such differences made an organism more able to live in the wild, it would have a better chance to survive, and would pass on its genes to its offspring, and they to their offspring. Any difference that would cause the plant or animal to have less of a chance to live would be less likely to be passed on, and would eventually die out altogether. In this way groups of similar plants or animals (called species) slowly change in shape and form so that they can live more successfully and have more offspring who will survive them.

I commented that Face Book never deletes our posts and that the amount of data there was substantial. If compiled and consolidated, it would be several hundred pages of data. A few of my Face Book friends suggested/encouraged me to write a book. I committed to start compiling, editing, and researching how to publish a book. Over the past year, that process has continued sometimes with great progress and sometimes with very little. The books provide a very personal and intimate view into my journey",-1.082214242219925

In tears I recognize that most in this nation really have forgotten (or worse, never knew at all) what this day really means. We are celebrating the anniversary of the independence of this country from tyranny... freedom from an oppressive government. We celebrate freedom from that government and bondage THROUGH GODLY PRINCIPLES by a group of ordinary (broken) men who recognized the importance of God's principles in achieving that freedom. How far have we fallen as a nation from that beginning?

Ultimately, instead of inducing the spiritual elevation that comes from removing what masks unseparateness, and from strengthening the bond to oneness, artistic media obtained illegally lowers the audience, and in this fashion, the whole is brought down too. ## Beds Are Burning In a similar manner, if art is an essential element of the feedback loop through which society stays on course towards the establishment of institutions that better respect human nature, then when art is devalued or corrupted, the retroaction it provides is misleading, or potentially worse, missing.

While older designs commonly incorporated a flexible rubber diaphragm or airspace inside the capsule to allow for volume changes caused by temperature or altitude, some modern liquid compasses utilize smaller housings and/or flexible capsule materials to accomplish the same result.

This was less obvious in Paris, since the formation of the National Guard made it the best policed city in Europe, but growing disorder in the provinces inevitably affected members of the Assembly.

Secondly, she had spent most of her life in Boulder, so everyone knew her. And her father was the local miller, which helped her chances quite a bit more than if he'd been the local pothole-filler.

The scene, regardless of its appeal, did not elevate me from my depressed mood, my distraction, and the potential tragedy that lay ahead.

The Counter-Reformation Catholic Church wanted to find painters who would paint beautiful art about God. They wanted people to like the art so much that they would think Protestantism was ugly and boring, and wouldn't want to start being part of a Protestant church. So the Catholic Church needed a new type of art, because Mannerism had been the most famous type of art for 100 years, and now it was boring. Caravaggio's paintings were new, and different from Mannerism. He painted in a way called naturalism, which means that he painted things how they actually looked.

They were surrounded by white light and vibrating noise. Then it faded instantly and they were in the middle of a forest. ""Where are we Franklin?"" Sally asked when she was sure she was all right.

They strayed hither and thither about the hills, running races down their sides. At last, Violet, who was usually the first to tire of sport, flung herself down in a sheltered spot between two stunted bushes of worse, and declared that she could not attempt the homeward walk without a few minutes' rest. ""Well, don't stay too long,"" said Faith. Violet, still panting and exhausted, leaned back upon the turf, resting her whole weight upon one elbow. Behind her, the hillside rose abruptly to a considerable height, and at her feet was a smooth piece of level ground. It was altogether as comfortable a resting-place as she could have desired. ""Faith,"" she cried, suddenly, ""what's this? My arm is sinking into the ground!"" She raised herself as she spoke, showing that the turf behind her was pressed inwards.

The gringo had to hold the glider firm against the cattails, which were trying to spring back on their intruder and dump them both into the lake. But Sally was overjoyed with gladness. She thanked Walter again, and promptly set off up the bank of the lake, scrambling through the reeds and weeds and over rocks, still wearing the harness. Already, a small crowd had gathered just above the lake, to see who could be in the colorful wing that had descended from their sky; it was a rare day when one of those graceful things swooped in for a visit.

Kurt stopped short in the middle of the concourse, causing a momentary traffic jam as people reacted to the sudden obstacle in their path. Mason ducked into a book kiosk and feigned interest in the bestseller rack while watching Kurt out of the corner of his eye. Turning in a circle, Kurt appeared to be looking for something.

Other times, like this morning when he told her he wanted to climb back into bed with her, tenderness softened his eyes and mouth. She thought of the first night they met and the way he'd seemed annoyed by the disturbance. She knew now that he'd been writing, and she _had_ interrupted him.

The undergrad sighed and shifted in his seat, looking about the small diner restlessly. It was more money than he had anticipated, and Kurt believed that the kid would go through hell trying to explain it to his father. He couldn't care less, though.

Sammy's tail was cut off, just like Samantha's was. Only difference was Sammy's tail was missing. Ann went back this morning and looked for it again and couldn't find it anywhere.""

Bunyan kept on eating, sending the barge men diving in fear every time his great fingers dipped in for another skewer. But Cookie knew there was nothing to fear. When the ham was all gone, Bunyan smiled and cupped his hands, throwing great splashes of crystal clear Superior water up into his face.

The worse part was Professor's Wade sudden collapse.

The Scots considered this a reversion to Roman Catholicism . Charles furthered English impositions on the Church of Scotland in 1636 and 1637 . This led to the First Bishops ' War between Charles and the Scots in 1639 . Charles called what came to be known as the Short Parliament to raise funds for the war , but he soon dissolved it when it began voicing opposition to his policies .

The term aerodynamics is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, the difference being that ""gas dynamics"" applies to the study of the motion of all gases, and is not limited to air. The formal study of aerodynamics began in the modern sense in the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts such as aerodynamic drag were recorded much earlier. Most of the early efforts in aerodynamics were directed toward achieving heavier-than-air flight, which was first demonstrated by Otto Lilienthal in 1891. Since then, the use of aerodynamics through mathematical analysis, empirical approximations, wind tunnel experimentation, and computer simulations has formed a rational basis for the development of heavier-than-air flight and a number of other technologies.

In 1726, Sir Isaac Newton became the first person to develop a theory of air resistance, making him one of the first aerodynamicists. Dutch-Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli followed in 1738 with Hydrodynamica in which he described a fundamental relationship between pressure, density, and flow velocity for incompressible flow known today as Bernoulli's principle, which provides one method for calculating aerodynamic lift. In 1757, Leonhard Euler published the more general Euler equations which could be applied to both compressible and incompressible flows. The Euler equations were extended to incorporate the effects of viscosity in the first half of the 1800s, resulting in the Navier–Stokes equations.

This method of sustainable hydrogen production is a major objective for the development of alternative energy systems. It is also predicted to be one of the more, if not the most, efficient ways of obtaining hydrogen from water.

An Assyrian calendar has been revived. Emerging in Sumer c. 3500 BC, cuneiform writing began as a system of pictograms. Around 3000 BC, the pictorial representations became simplified and more abstract as the number of characters in use grew smaller. The original Sumerian script was adapted for the writing of the Akkadian, Assyrian, and Hittite languages. The Kültepe texts, which were written in Old Assyrian, had Hittite loanwords and names, which constitute the oldest record of any language of the Indo-European language family. Most of the archaeological evidence is typical of Anatolia rather than of Assyria, but the use of both cuneiform and the dialect is the best indication of Assyrian presence. From 1700 BC and onward, the Sumerian language was preserved by the ancient Babylonians and Assyrians only as a liturgical and classical language for religious, artistic and scholarly purposes.

Scholarly literature usually concentrates on temples, palaces, city walls and gates, and other monumental buildings, but occasionally one finds works on residential architecture as well. Archaeological surface surveys also allowed for the study of urban form in early Mesopotamian cities. Brick is the dominant material, as the material was freely available locally, whereas building stone had to be brought a considerable distance to most cities. The ziggurat is the most distinctive form, and cities often had large gateways, of which the Ishtar Gate from Neo-Babylonian Babylon, decorated with beasts in polychrome brick, is the most famous, now largely in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.

The first inscriptions in Assyria proper, called Old Assyrian (OA), were made in the Old Assyrian period. The ancient Assyrians also used Sumerian in their literature and liturgy, although to a more limited extent in the Middle- and Neo-Assyrian periods, when Akkadian became the main literary language. During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and Akkadian-speakers, which included widespread bilingualism. The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence. This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the 3rd millennium BC as a Sprachbund. Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate), but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.

However later observations with the New Horizons space probe from outside the zodiacal light reduced this to roughly 200 billion (). Galaxies come in three main types: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars. A slightly more extensive description of galaxy types based on their appearance is given by the Hubble sequence. Since the Hubble sequence is entirely based upon visual morphological type (shape), it may miss certain important characteristics of galaxies such as star formation rate in starburst galaxies and activity in the cores of active galaxies. The Hubble classification system rates elliptical galaxies on the basis of their ellipticity, ranging from E0, being nearly spherical, up to E7, which is highly elongated. These galaxies have an ellipsoidal profile, giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the viewing angle. Their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little interstellar matter. Consequently, these galaxies also have a low portion of open clusters and a reduced rate of new star formation. Instead, they are dominated",-2.30452606678009

AR can be defined as a system that incorporates three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects. The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment), or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment). This experience is seamlessly interwoven with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real environment. In this way, augmented reality alters one's ongoing perception of a real-world environment, whereas virtual reality completely replaces the user's real-world environment with a simulated one. Augmented reality is related to two largely synonymous terms: mixed reality and computer-mediated reality. The primary value of augmented reality is the manner in which components of the digital world blend into a person's perception of the real world, not as a simple display of data, but through the integration of immersive sensations, which are perceived as natural parts of",-2.2159140872955323

It has been known since the work of scientists like Robert Eason and Steven Hillyard in the 1970’s that the brain waves that occur in response to both visual and auditory events change depending on whether the person is paying attention to the sight or sound or ignoring it. In the experiment we described, we saw that the brain waves were larger for the target picture when it appeared in the expected location than if it appeared in the unexpected location (Figure 2). This means that the visual neurons in the brain had a bigger electrical response when the study participants were paying attention to the expected location when the target appeared.
