C-2021-2_U41,"""When a bid is sent through a channel, noise can sometimes cause a bid reversal. If the probability of a bid reversal (reversal probability) is p, the probability of sending an incorrect block when transmitting a block is P = 1-{(1-p) to the kth power} (assuming that the block size is k bits.) Here, even if p = 0.001, the block error rate is 60% or more. It is necessary to improve the path and reduce p.However, considering physical and economic limitations in improving, it is important to devise coding.Here, automatic error detection, automatic error correction, etc. It is important to make each block redundant and design so that the bit strings (called codewords) that can appear in each block are not similar to each other (same principle as the middle name). Automatic error detection and automatic correction will become easier, and even if you make a small mistake, you will be able to restore it properly.
Here, for two bit strings x and y of equal length, d(x,y)=(The number of I where the Ith bit of x and the Ith bit of y are different is defined as the Hamming distance between x and y. Here, looking at the principle of automatic detection and automatic correction, when codewords are separated by s+1, at most s errors can be automatically detected, and codewords are separated by 2t+1. Then t errors can be corrected.
Further, there is a tertiary repetition code (majority code) for error correction using a repetition code. When the information is encoded, if it is ◯, it is changed to ◯◯◯, and if it is ●, it is changed to ●●● and transmitted, and when it is decoded, it is replaced by one symbol, which is larger. By doing so, error correction can be performed when one bit or less of the three bits in each block is inverted. At this time, since the Hamming distance between the codewords is 3, when the coverage of each code is set to ""Hamming distance is 1 or less"", the coverage does not overlap. Therefore, if the number of errors in each block is one or less, automatic correction is possible. This method is suitable for lowering the block error rate, but the bit amount is tripled, so the coding efficiency is poor. In the same way, an n (n=2k+1)-order repetition code can perform error correction when the number of inversions in each block (n bits) is k or less. At this time, the error rate can be lowered by increasing n, but the transmission rate is also lowered at the same time. Here, the channel capacity is a value specific to the channel and is the upper limit of the coding efficiency R. This is obtained by C=1-H(p)=1-{plog(-p)+(1-p)log(1-p)}. Here, given a channel with a channel capacity of C, there exists a channel that satisfies the coding efficiency R=C−a and the block error rate P≤b for arbitrary positive numbers a and b (communication road coding theorem.). In other words, the coding efficiency R can be brought as close as possible to C, and the block error rate P can be made infinitely small.
Furthermore, as another way of coding ingenuity, by dividing the message into m-bit blocks and adding a check bit to each block to make n bits, and designing the Hamming distance between codewords to be as large as possible, There are also ways to make it easier to detect and correct errors. ""","""When information is transmitted, bits may be inverted, so it is necessary to make the bit strings (codewords) dissimilar by adding redundancy to facilitate automatic error detection and correction.

The probability of such inversion is called inversion probability, and the probability of error is called block error rate. To reduce the block error rate, In such channel coding, first, in the encoding stage, the message is divided into blocks and each block is made redundant.When it is transmitted, received and decoded, It is necessary to be able to correct errors.Here, it is necessary to devise a way to make it redundant.When the codewords (bit strings that can appear in each block) are separated by s+1 or more, at most Automatic error detection for s errors (detects bit inversion and resend) possible, automatic error correction for at most t errors when codewords are separated by 2t+1 or more (automatic error detection) As a means of error correction, there is a repetition code (determining the original one by majority vote at the time of decoding), and in this method, when the (2k+1)th repetition code is Error correction is possible when the number of bit inversions in each block (2k+1 bits) is k or less.By using this method, the block error rate can be lowered, but the encoding efficiency R deteriorates, so the transmission speed decreases. To overcome this shortcoming, the channel coding theorem plays an active role: ""When a channel with a channel capacity of C is given, for any positive numbers ε and b, the encoding efficiency R is R=C -ε, there exists a channel code whose block error rate is less than or equal to b”. (Here, channel capacity is a value specific to a channel and is represented by C=1-H(p).) By using this theorem, R can be made as close to C as possible. While it can, the block error rate can be made arbitrarily small. That is, channel coding first divides the message into m-bit blocks, and then adds check bits to each block to make it n bits. At this time, note that the number of codewords is 2@m out of 2@n. For two bit strings x and y of the same length, the number of i when the i-th bit of x and the i-th bit of y are different is called the Hamming distance, and the Hamming distance between codewords is as large as possible.

→With the development and spread of computers and networks, the importance of cryptography is increasing rapidly.

Caesar Cipher
・The oldest cipher (around 50 BC)
It is said to have been used by the ancient Roman soldier Julius Caesar.
・Shift the characters of the message (plaintext) to the right by K characters to encrypt it.

Attack on Caesar Cipher
・How can I get the plaintext from the encrypted document?

""brute force attack""
・Let the set of character types be M
・If you try all the key candidates K = 0 to M-1, you will definitely get plaintext someday.

single substitution cipher
・In addition to simply shifting K characters, any correspondence can be used as a key for encryption as long as there is a one-to-one correspondence between characters.

Ciphertext = Convert plaintext characters by mapping F (encryption)
Convert (decrypt) plaintext = ciphertext characters by mapping F^-1
→The brute force attack becomes more difficult as the number of types of mapping increases.

""Frequency Analysis Attack""
Take advantage of the fact that there is a bias in the frequency of characters in normal plaintext

Taisho key cryptography (Caesar cipher, single substitution cipher) contrasts encryption and compound keys, so we have to think about how to send the key. → key distribution problem

Asymmetric key cryptography ""Use different keys for encryption and decryption""
Using two types of keys: public key and private key (public key cryptography)

・Recipients should make their public keys public so that anyone can understand them.
・The sender encrypts the plaintext with the recipient's public key and sends it to the recipient.
- The sender decrypts the ciphertext with his own private key.

RSA encryption
1977 First public-key cipher, single substitution cipher, developed by MIT scholars

Divide the information (bit string) to be encrypted into appropriate size blocks.
Consider each block as a binary number and consider encrypting a sequence of non-negative integers.
