The number of steps is always 1/2 or less, and even if the number of steps is the largest, it always ends when the size of the search range becomes 1. Therefore, the number of steps of binary search for a set of n elements does not exceed log(2)n. In addition, each step performs at most one element comparison.Therefore, the time complexity of binary search is O(logn).Therefore, binary search is overwhelmingly faster than linear search.

So, we can see that the binary search is faster than the linear search whose time complexity is O(kn). Binary search is faster even for text search problems. The purpose of the text retrieval problem is to obtain the occurrence position of a word or phrase that appears in a sentence. Here, let the input be ""text string T, pattern string P"" and the output be ""the position where P appears in T"". Let T be a text string of length m.

In order to speed up information retrieval, the data is sometimes sorted and rearranged in advance. If the data is not sorted, a linear search is used. In the worst case, the search time is long.When the data is sorted, the size of the elements is compared from the middle of the data, and the search is divided into the first half and the second half depending on the size, and it is a binary search. If it is a binary search, the search range is halved, and it is overwhelmingly faster than a linear search.Binary search can also be performed by sorting the keyword search lexicographically.The string that ends at the end is a suffix This sorting of possible suffixes performs a binary search of the text, which was known in 1991.

Also, it would be nice to have such a function in Moodle, but I would like you not to force the specification of the function on students. Students are not debuggers.
I would like you to spend more time proving the theorems in the textbook than Moodle functions.
In addition, what is the meaning of the task of creating handwritten notes and BR-MAP every time? I think that each student has his or her own way of studying, and do lectures at university put more emphasis on the process of learning rather than actually learning?
I know it's hard to get grades during the corona crisis, but I would appreciate it if you could do it through exercises, quizzes, and reports.
Lastly, I would like to ask you to increase the number of shortcuts to each lecture in Yellow Moodle. Since the classes are now online and the number of lectures to be registered in Moodle has increased, I would like to ask you to search for Friday classes that cannot be displayed, which will take a lot of time.
