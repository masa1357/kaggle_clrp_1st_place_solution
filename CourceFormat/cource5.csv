They are mainly physical approaches (mainly using mathematical formulas) and CS approaches (methods are mainly algorithmic) for nature. The CS approach can prove the correctness of computational means and the limits of efficiency (on the other hand, the physical approach cannot), and examples of methods such as a quiz are included. Among the fields of basic science, there is computer science, which is the science of properly understanding computation (everything that is done on a computer). A problem is a mathematically rigorously defined function whose answer is uniquely determined for any problem instance x€X, that is, the problem f : If X → Y, the input is x€ If X is the output, f(x) is determined.At this point, if it is too vague, it cannot be a subject of computer science.Here, computation is defined as a given problem case x. It is to find the answer f(x) when the function is calculated.All the computer does is this calculation, but the computer cannot calculate the answer just by being given a problem.The calculation procedure of the function is not taught by humans. The procedure that shows how to calculate this function is called an algorithm.Here, the program is the one that describes the algorithm in terms that the computer understands.The calculation in the computer is a simple (primitive) calculation It can be achieved by combining , where the algorithm should finish the calculation in a finite amount of time, since it cannot take infinite time to calculate, the number of basic operations performed before the algorithm finishes is called the number of calculation steps, and the fewer the calculation steps, the shorter the execution time of the algorithm.
Consider an example algorithm. Suppose there are n coins, one of which is a counterfeit coin with a different weight. At this time, when considering the height of the rooted tree, the height of a ternary tree with at least 3 to the kth power of leaves (the lowest leaf with nothing attached below it) is at least k. Using this, if there are 3 to the power of k coins, the balance will be at least k times.

D-2022_U55,"""A sampled value signal is a signal obtained by sampling a continuous value signal (analog signal) at each sampling period. The higher the sampling frequency, the higher the accuracy, and the lower the sampling frequency, the better the real-time performance. The sampling theorem is the maximum frequency of a continuous value signal. If you don't sample at a sampling frequency that is at least twice as large as the component, you will get noise, and you won't be able to recover the original signal.""","""Understanding the sampling theorem.""",,,"""I'm glad I was able to understand the sampling theorem, which has been nuanced until now.""",1
