C-2021-1_U54,"""Last time, there was an introduction that data can be divided into structured data and unstructured data, and this time we learned about the latter. Unstructured data processing consists of language processing, image processing, and audio processing. one was mentioned.
First of all, regarding language data, language data is data represented by character strings. On the other hand, there is a technique of analyzing by a computer called natural language processing. Examples include frequent language (the process of finding the most frequently occurring word in language data), translation, retrieval, summarization, and dialogue. These deal with just strings, but some deal with the semantics of strings as well. Examples include semantic analysis (quantifying each word or sentence according to its meaning), paraphrase analysis (does the meaning of the sentence be the same even though the words are different?), and sentiment analysis (guessing the emotions hidden in the sentence). ), sentence generation, etc.
Next is the image data, but an image can be viewed as a vector. A numerical value is assigned to each color. For example, an image of 4 million pixels is a vector of 4 million dimensions. In other words, ""creating an image"" means ""creating a vector"", and adjusting the appearance of an image means ""manipulating a vector"". There are many challenges in analyzing image data, including image recognition, computer vision, image processing, image generation, and feature extraction.
Finally, regarding audio data, sound is a ""wave"", and it can be converted into data by quantifying its height. Sound can be broadly classified into three categories: human voice, music, and environmental sound. Examples of speech (human voice) analysis include speech recognition, speaker recognition, emotion recognition, and speech synthesis. Examples of music data analysis include music analysis, automatic composition, acoustic analysis, and music recognition. Examples of environmental sound data analysis include environmental sound recognition, sound source separation (separating multiple sounds), sound source identification (where the sound comes from), and abnormal sound detection.
The method of guessing ""what"" is called pattern recognition. Humans do this on a daily basis, but it is difficult for computers. Since the computer cannot freely recognize anything, the object that can be recognized is decided in advance as a premise. A pattern recognizer designed for animals cannot recognize automobiles, and a pattern recognizer designed for automobiles cannot recognize animals. At present, there are only such specialized recognizers, and they are becoming familiar to us, such as face recognition, meal recognition, voice recognition (smart speakers), and character recognition (zip code recognition).
""Similar"" is the key word for the basic principle of computer pattern recognition. However, as we learned in the previous lecture, ""similar"" is very ambiguous (""where"", ""how much"", etc.) and difficult. Therefore, it is necessary for AI to perform machine learning using a large amount of data. Draw a boundary line in the large amount of prepared data, and when it is done, recognize which side of the boundary line the object is on. Recently, many of them are based on deep neural networks. A simple image of pattern recognition in a deep neural network is to cut (drawing a boundary line) something that is difficult to separate (the boundary line is difficult to draw) by devising the situation on the side that can be divided (bending the space). Since we do not know from the beginning how to ``devise the situation on the divided side (bending the space)'', we need to decide on the method through trial and error.

Also, music data analysis includes music analysis for estimating chord progressions and acoustic analysis used for vocal extraction.

Pattern recognition is a technology that targets various data and guesses what it is, and is used for image recognition and voice recognition. However, pattern recognition is easy for humans, but it is difficult for computers because it is necessary to decide in advance what objects can be recognized, and it is difficult to quantify similarities. Therefore, in recent years, computer pattern recognition is generated by machine learning, in which a large amount of data is prepared and boundary lines are drawn.

C-2021-2_U9,"""We divide unstructured data processing into three categories: language processing, image processing, and voice/music processing.
First, let's talk about language processing. In the first place, language data is data represented by a character string. A technique for analyzing this language data by a computer is called natural language processing. Examples include frequent language (the process of finding the most frequently occurring word in language data), translation, searching, proofreading, and dialogue. In addition, ``semantic analysis'' that finds the connections between words and assigns meaning, ``sentiment analysis'' that infers the emotions hidden in sentences, ``sentence generation'' and ``paraphrase analysis'' are also natural language processing. It is one kind. During such processing, the computer digitizes each word or sentence according to its meaning and represents it as a vector (=set of numbers), thereby enabling calculation of words.
Next, image processing. Since images are vectors, computers and other devices always handle very high-dimensional vectors when handling image data. Analysis of such image data includes ""image recognition"", ""image processing"" to correct the color and brightness of images, ""computer vision"" to perform 3D stereoscopic vision and tracking, ""image generation"" and ""feature extraction"". etc.
Finally, I would like to talk about voice/music processing. By quantifying the height of sound waves, ""sound"" becomes time-series data for computers. Sound can be roughly divided into three categories: voice, music, and environmental sound. Speech data analysis includes speech/speaker/emotion recognition and speech synthesis. Music data analysis, on the other hand, includes music and acoustic analysis, music recognition, music data compression, and the like. In the case of environmental sound data, recognition of environmental sounds, separation/identification of sound sources, detection of abnormal sounds, and the like can be mentioned.
As described above, computers recognize various data, and this ""method of guessing what data is"" is called ""pattern recognition."" We humans have been doing pattern recognition since childhood, and we can do it unconsciously, with high precision, and at high speed. However, pattern recognition is still difficult for computers. In the first place, when a computer performs pattern recognition, it is necessary to determine in advance what objects (classes) can be recognized. The basic principle of ""pattern recognition"" by a computer is to select the most ""similar"" image from pre-registered images and their object names. However, in this case, there is a problem that an appropriate standard of ""similar"" is ambiguous, such as ""where"" is similar to ""how much"". Therefore, in recent years, using a large amount of data and deep learning, many pattern recognition mechanisms have been adopted in which a boundary line is drawn in a large amount of data prepared by a deep neural network and identified based on the boundary line. ing. At this time, the deep neural network bends the space so that boundary lines (straight lines) can be drawn.

Pattern recognition can be rephrased as a process of selecting a class of input data by targeting various data and guessing what it is. It is easy for humans but difficult for computers because there are no rules about how similar they are (where and how much).

Unstructured data analysis includes language processing, image processing, voice/music processing, etc., all of which are treated as data. Also, it is very important to consider vectors in data analysis.
Regarding language processing, language data is data that can be represented by character strings, and is used for various things such as translation and proofreading using natural language processing. For image processing, an image is a collection of pixels, so it is treated as a vector. As for audio processing, the height of sound waves that change with time can be digitized and processed as data.
Pattern recognition is the process of having a computer guess what data such as images and sounds are. In addition to image recognition and voice recognition, there are many variations such as action recognition and emotion recognition. Pattern recognition is a simple thing that humans can do naturally, but it is difficult for computers to ""grasp the whole"", and the objects that can be recognized are decided in advance. The basic principle of pattern recognition is to ""find similarities"", but it is difficult to define ""similar"". In recent pattern recognition, deep neural networks are machine-learned with large amounts of data. First, prepare a large amount of data and draw a boundary line to distinguish them. It is necessary to devise ways to make it easier to pull. However, since the bending method is not known from the beginning, trial and error is required. A pattern is represented by a vector (feature vector), and the feature of an object is dropped into coordinates as each element. The more elements there are, the higher the dimension of the vector. Various patterns are distributed on that coordinate, and it is determined by which one is closest to what you want to check.

Image data can be thought of as vectors. The image data that we usually deal with are very high-dimensional vectors.
When converting sound into data, it is necessary to quantify the height of the sound wave, which changes from moment to moment. Computers use sound spectrograms to analyze speech.
Pattern recognition is a method of guessing what a given piece of data is. When humans and computers are compared, humans can more easily and accurately recognize patterns. Objects (classes) that can be recognized are predetermined, and other data cannot be recognized. Simply put, it is fundamental to think of things that are “similar” to what you know. The degree of ""similarity"" is not defined mathematically, so it is vague.
In recent pattern recognition, a boundary line is drawn in a large amount of data, and recognition is performed based on which region the data is in. Using a deep neural network, it becomes possible to draw a straight boundary line by folding the space. Deep neural networks use simple addition and multiplication.
