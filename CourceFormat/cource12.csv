In the main subject of the class, first of all, a vector is a collection of multiple numerical values ​​written in parentheses separated by commas, and has meaning in order. There are various ways to use vectors, and if they are familiar to us, they can be expressed in dishes, documents, and images. In addition, linear algebra is often used to analyze data using vectors, and matrices are also used to represent data. Also, since vectors are combinations of data, they are ideal for finding relationships between data. In summary, the basic tools used in data analysis are ""close/far"" and ""similar/dissimilar"". In other words, it is about recognizing data, organizing data, and differentiating data.
Next is distance. ""Distance"" has various meanings, and in daily conversation it represents physical distance or emotional distance, but in data analysis, distance is the distance regardless of dissimilarity between data and whether or not there is a unit. is used. By the way, mathematically, it can be called a distance if it satisfies the conditions of non-degenerateness, symmetry, and triangle inequality.
Next, regarding the similarity, it can be said that the smaller the distance, the more similar, but the larger the similarity, the more similar. Also, the definition is not as strict as the distance.
These two are used for homology search, clustering, strain separation, discrimination, anomaly detection, etc. Next is the distance between data. This represents how far the two data are separated. The most representative distance is the Euclidean distance, which is expressed using the Pythagorean theorem. Also, this can be expressed as n of n dimensions continues to increase.
A city that cannot be slanted is called Manhattan, and such a distance is called Manhattan distance. It is called max distance to check the most different point. The distance between two sequences of the same length is called the Hamming distance. And it is called an edit distance that is okay even if the length of the series is different.
In addition, the degree of similarity of mathematical sets is called the Jaccard coefficient, which expresses how much they are in common. A method of measuring directional similarity is called cosine similarity.
In addition, by using the learned distance and similarity, grouping of data sets, data anomaly, and data can also be “recognized”. Image recognition and clustering are possible.

First, in the economic system, for example, charts (vectors) are used to predict stock prices, and stock prices are predicted from this change trend. Using vectors representing the high, low, opening and closing prices of stock prices, the computer learns trends and predicts future stock prices.
Another example of how data science is used in pharmacy is the use of vectors to represent the structures of compounds, and group together compounds with similar structures.
For example, it can be expressed using a vector so that if there is a specific structure, it will be 1, and if it is not, it will be 0. This makes it easier to compare compounds. In addition, by expressing it as a vector, it can be used for various machine learning.
And in the study of law, for example, data science can be used to explore laws and regulations from an engineering perspective. In addition, by representing the presence or absence of a specific word by a vector, it is possible to represent a legal document (a character string written in a natural language) by a vector. It also enables deep learning.
A vector is a group of numbers, and the order in a vector has meaning. Vectors are flexible. For example, a person can be represented as a vector in terms of a particular aspect, such as health status. Food can also be expressed as a vector. In this way, it is possible to express what the data represents and the characteristics of the data by combining the vectors.
Such vectors are combinations of data. By combining various data, relationships between themes and new things can be found. For example, patterns can be found by combining a large number of data. Representing data as vectors also facilitates the basic tools of data analysis: ""close/far"" and ""similar/dissimilar"" comparisons.
Distance in data analysis is often expressed as ""similar/dissimilar"" and is a relatively free concept.

In addition to the Euclidean distance, there are Manhattan distance and max distance (the overall difference cannot be evaluated because only one element is evaluated).

The greater the similarity, the more similar it is.If things are expressed as vectors, various types of distance and similarity can be used.Analysis based on distance and similarity includes homology search, clustering, phylogenetic classification, judgment, and anomaly detection. 2 The distance between data is how much they differ.There are Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and max distance, but max distance is used when you want to say that if even one element is significantly different, it is quite different. The Hamming distance is the distance between two sequences.The edit distance is the distance between two sequences, and the advantage is that the length of the sequences can be different.This is a generalization of the Hamming distance.The jaccard coefficient is Mathematics set similarity.Cosine similarity is a way to measure directional similarity.Distance and similarity can be applied to group, anomaly, and recognize data sets.Handwritten digits in image recognition It can be applied to discriminate.Clustering can be used to collect similar data and find groups.Vectors are one of the representative methods of expressing data.It is a mathematical expression of what is strong and how strong it is.

There are max distance (maximum distance of each element of 2 vectors), Hamming distance (number of different elements of 2 vectors), edit distance (number of corrections of elements of 2 vectors), etc.
Conversely, similarity between data can be given as a concept opposite to distance.
For example, Jaccard coefficient (2 vectors (number of common elements of 2 vectors) / (number of all elements of 2 vectors (common elements are counted as one))), cosine similarity (using the inner product formula of vectors )and so on.
Examples include data clustering using distance and similarity.

Images are also vectors. Assign numbers to colors. In the case of a 0-scale image containing intermediate colors, for example, 0 can be expressed as black, 256 as white, and gray as 122, and so on. The image is also a vector because it expresses the image in a neat arrangement. When we take pictures with a camera, we are actually dealing with very high-dimensional vectors! Linear algebra has a lot to do with analyzing data represented by vectors, since matrices are also collections of vectors.
The reason why we analyze data as vectors is that it is convenient to use vectors when we want to analyze data from multiple perspectives.
The basic tools of data analysis are far/near, similar/dissimilar.
There is not only one type of distance, but if you can't make a mess with a certain distance, you have to express it with another method of distance, so the method of data analysis changes greatly depending on the type of distance you use.

C-2022-1_U89,"""In this lecture, we learned about vectors, distances, similarities, etc. A vector is a collection of multiple numerical values. Objects can be expressed as vectors.Multi-dimensional vectors can be used to analyze target data from various angles.However, it is not possible to express all of the data because it is expressed by some elements in the data. A vector in an image is a pixel.At the moment the shutter is pressed, a 4-million-dimensional vector is generated.Furthermore, because there are three primary colors, Red, Green, and Blue, each is a 4-million-dimensional vector. There are actually 12 million dimensional vectors.When dealing with data represented by vectors, linear algebra is often used.Matrices play an important role in data analysis, such as matrices as collections of vectors and matrices as expressions of correspondence relationships. A vector is a combination of data.By preparing a large number of data that you cannot understand with one combination, you can see the relationship between data.About data, close, far, similar, and dissimilar are data Fundamental in analysis: identifying, summarizing, and distinguishing data.
Distance in data analysis is the difference between data. If the distance is small, it means that the data are similar. Similarity is the opposite concept of distance. The smaller the distance and the larger the similarity, the more similar the data are. Mathematically, distance is strictly defined, but similarity is less so. Representing things as vectors allows us to use different kinds of distances and similarities. Homology search, clustering/system separation, judgment, anomaly detection, etc. can be performed. Distance is fundamental to data analysis. Also, distances include Euclidean distance, L1 distance (Manhattan distance), max distance, and the like. It is necessary to consider which type of distance to use because the results of data analysis may change depending on the type of distance. """,,,,,-3
