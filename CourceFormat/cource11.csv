""","There are two types of data collection, such as a ``complete survey'' in which the entire survey target is investigated, and a ``sample survey'' in which a part of the population to be surveyed is selected and surveyed. There are two types of sample surveys: the significant sampling method and the random sampling method. The significant sampling method is a method of extracting samples from survey targets that are easy for the surveyor to collect, and has the drawback of ""sample selection bias."" Sample selection bias is the bias of the sample drawn, such that the survey results are not representative of the population as a whole. Random sampling methods such as ""simple random sampling"" and ""multistage sampling"" are effective methods of collecting data to eliminate this bias as much as possible. In addition, there are biases such as ""inductive bias"" that depends on the properties used, and ""annotation bias"" that uses annotations of data such as voice and images as clues. Personal information refers to information that can identify an individual, such as biometric information and data containing personal identification codes. Codes assigned when using services such as passport numbers are also personal information. Personal information must always be protected. However, it is possible to provide personal information to a third party exceptionally when it is necessary to protect a person's life, body, or property, or when the information is anonymously processed. As a contrasting data, there is what is called ""open data"". Public data that can be used for secondary purposes, is machine-readable, and can be used free of charge.

In general statistical surveys, it is practically impossible to conduct a complete survey, and the effort required for the survey simply increases. On the other hand, sample surveys, in which a part of the population to be surveyed is selected and surveyed, include the significant sampling method and the random sampling method. The significance sampling method allows the planner of the survey to select samples based on their own judgment. For example, there is expedient sampling, in which samples are extracted from survey targets that are easy to collect. You can narrow down the target you want to investigate by your own judgment = Data collection is easy, but since the survey is conducted by your own judgment, the survey results often do not represent the entire population, and your own judgment is wrong. If so, the results may differ from the truth.
There is no guarantee that the past situation and the data you want to see are the same, but the bias created by predicting the future from past data is called sample selection bias. For example, there are policy decisions based on questionnaires of current employees who measure their grades after admission based on entrance exam scores, and media interviews, and only arbitrarily selected opinions are reported as if they were generalities. It can also be said to be a malicious sample selection bias. Bias that depends on the properties of the method used is called inductive bias, and different methods will give different results.

Ideally, there should be a 100% inspection. However, the disadvantage is that this is difficult to achieve and cannot be actually performed.The advantage of 100% inspection is that the data obtained is true.The disadvantage is that it is virtually 100% You can't do a test, and that's what led to sampling, which is taking a subset of the population to study and studying it, and there are two types of sampling here. Significant sampling method / random sampling method.Significant sampling method refers to selecting a sample based on a certain standard.A typical example is convenience sampling.It is to extract a sample from survey subjects that are easy to collect. The advantage of the significance sampling method is that it is easy to collect data, and the disadvantage is that it is often not representative of the entire population because the survey is conducted based on independent judgment. Bias means bias.To avoid bias, random sampling of subjects is necessary.Other possible biases include the prediction of future data from past data. There is a possibility that the prediction will be incorrect, or other factors cannot be considered.There is also the possibility of inductive bias and annotation bias.Inductive bias is different depending on how to predict with the same data Therefore, it is necessary to appropriately evaluate the validity of the prediction method.In addition, annotation bias is a clear criterion for whether or not annotations made by humans can be trusted.

C-2021-2_U9,"There are two types of survey methods: ``complete survey'', in which the entire survey target is investigated, and ``sample survey,'' in which a part of the survey target is selected and examined. In a complete survey, all survey subjects are called the ""population"". This method has the advantage that the data obtained is truthful and can be used when the population size is small or when the environment is in place to survey the entire population. On the other hand, it requires a lot of labor for the survey, and it is virtually impossible to use this method in general statistical surveys. Sampling, on the other hand, does. There are two types of sampling methods. Significant sampling and random sampling. Significant extraction is a method in which the survey planner selects samples based on his or her own judgment. While this method facilitates data collection, survey results may not be representative of the population as a whole or may be untrue. On the other hand, methods such as ``simple random sampling,'' which randomly selects data directly from the population, and ``multi-stage sampling,'' which randomly selects data again within a randomly selected group, are designed to minimize sample selection bias. Data can be collected.
Bias other than sample selection bias include recursion bias and annotation bias. There are a wide variety of data analysis methods, and the results differ depending on the method used. In addition, when using data for data analysis and AI, human annotations are often used as clues, and there is a possibility that these annotations are also biased.
The Personal Information Protection Law is a law aimed at protecting personal information while maintaining a balance between the protection of personal information and the utilization of personal information. Here, personal information is information about a living individual, and includes information that can identify a specific individual and information that includes an individual identification code. In principle, personal information cannot be provided to a third party without the consent of the data owner. However, (1) when it is necessary to protect a person's life, body, or property, (2) when it is possible to opt out at the person's will, and when the necessary information is communicated to the person and notified to the Personal Information Protection Commission, (3) anonymization processing is performed. If it is information (personal information processed so that individuals cannot be identified), it is possible to provide personal information to a third party. However, in the case of special care-required personal information, it cannot be provided to a third party even if it is possible to opt out in ②. Here, special care-required personal information refers to the person's race, creed, social status, medical history, criminal history, the fact that he/she has been harmed by a crime, and to prevent unfair discrimination, prejudice and disadvantage against the person. This refers to personal information that includes descriptions, etc. specified by government ordinance as items that require special consideration in handling.
Open data is public data that can be used for secondary purposes (that is, can be used for commercial purposes), is machine-readable, and can be used free of charge. In other words, it can be said that it is public data that is easy for both citizens and companies to use. (Just because the data is published on the website does not necessarily mean that it is open data.) and solving the problems of In addition, the government is promoting open data by creating laws. Examples of private sector utilization of municipal open data include disaster prevention, tourism, and child-rearing.

C-2021-2_U91,"""Today's content started with an explanation of data collection methods and biases. When investigating something, we would like to investigate based on as accurate data as possible, but we started by talking about how to collect it. Ideal. A typical survey method is a complete survey that examines the entire population and the survey results are absolutely true. It is only conducted when the environment is in place or when the population size is small, such as the grades of students in the class.The method taken there is a sample survey in which a part of the population is selected and investigated. There are two types of sampling methods for sample surveys: significant sampling and random sampling.Significant sampling is the selection of samples based on independent judgment.An example of this is the convenience of selecting samples from survey subjects that are easy to collect. Significant sampling makes it easier to collect data because you can narrow down the sample based on your own judgment, but in many cases the sample does not represent the entire population, and if your own judgment is wrong, you may get data that is not true. I might put it away.
When selecting samples, sample selection bias may occur. To avoid this, we can randomly select a sample directly from the population. Such a method is called a simple random sampling method, and dice and roulette are typical examples. There is also a multistage sampling method that randomly selects a group and randomly samples within the group. A common sample selection bias is, for example, predicting the future from past data, but there is no guarantee that the past and future conditions will be the same. There is also survivorship bias. This occurs in cases where post-enrollment data for unsuccessful students is not available, even when trying to extrapolate post-enrollment performance from entrance exam scores. In addition, minorities may be discriminated against because of a biased sample drawn. Street interviews by the media can be said to be the worst form of sample selection bias because they report only arbitrarily selected opinions as if they were generalizations. In addition to sample selection bias, inductive bias, which depends on the nature of the method used and can lead to different results if different methods are used, is also used as a clue when analyzing data or using it for AI. Annotation bias etc. caused by annotation may occur.
Next, we talked about data that should be properly protected and data that should be actively used. A representative example of the former is personal information, and a representative example of the latter is open data. Personal information refers to information about a living individual that can identify a specific individual or that includes an individual identification code. The Act on the Protection of Personal Information was created to protect this, and the goal is to maintain an appropriate balance between protection and use, rather than simply restricting its use. In principle, personal information cannot be provided to a third party without the consent of the data owner. Exceptions may be made if the information has been submitted to the Information Protection Commission or if the information has been processed anonymously.
Open data refers to open data that can be used for secondary purposes, is machine-readable, and can be used free of charge, among the data held by administrative agencies. Here, ""secondary use"" means ""may be used for commercial purposes"", and ""machine-readable"" means ""numerical data that is not PDF or images"". The significance of open data includes the resolution of various issues through the promotion of public participation and public-private collaboration, the sophistication and acceleration of administration, the improvement of transparency and reliability, and the resolution of various regional issues. The use of open data is encouraged by the Basic Act on the Promotion of Public and Private Sector Data Utilization, which obliges local governments to take necessary measures so that citizens can easily use the public and private sector data they possess. etc., are being used.

As an example, there is a significant sampling method in which the survey planner selects a sample based on his or her own judgment.A typical example of this is convenience sampling.This is easy to collect, but it is biased by the planner, so Survey results are often not representative of the population as a whole.This bias is bias.An example of this is sample selection bias.To avoid this, random selection is necessary.

Personal information is one type of data that should be properly protected. There is a law related to this, the Personal Information Protection Law. The definition of personal information includes information that can identify an individual and personal identification code. Provision of personal information to a third party is said to be impossible without the consent of the data owner. However, as an exception, when it is necessary to protect a person's life, body, property, etc., there are cases where it is possible to stop providing (opt out) at the will of the person. However, sensitive personal information may or may not be opted out. Although the range of handling of such mere personal information is narrow, it can be provided to a third party by processing it so that an individual cannot be identified, which is called anonymously processed information.
Open data is data that should be actively utilized and that anyone can use. It mainly refers to public data that is easy for citizens and businesses to use.

C-2022-1_U58,"""When you want to investigate something using statistical research in surveys and data collection, and when you want to survey based on the most accurate data possible, how do you collect data?
The ideal situation is a complete survey that examines all of the survey targets. All study subjects are called the ""population"".
A complete survey can be used when the environment is in place to survey the entire population or when the size of the population is small. The advantage is that the data obtained from the survey is true, but the disadvantage is that it is virtually impossible to conduct a complete survey in general statistical surveys, and the effort involved in the survey is simply too great.
If a complete survey is impossible, there is a ""sample survey"" in which a part of the population to be surveyed is selected and surveyed. There are two types of sample extraction (sampling method): significant sampling and random sampling.
　Significant extraction method means that the survey planner extracts a sample based on his/her own judgment. A representative example is convenience sampling, in which samples are extracted from survey targets that are easy to collect. The significance sampling method has the advantage of making it easier to collect data because the survey targets can be narrowed down by “independent judgment,” but since the survey is conducted by independent judgment, the survey results often do not represent the entire population. There is a disadvantage. Therefore, if the independent judgment is wrong, there is a possibility that the result different from the truth will come out.
The following method is used to collect data so as to avoid sample selection bias (bias is ""bias"") as much as possible. A simple random sampling method that selects data at random directly from the population. A multistage sampling method that randomly selects a group and randomly samples within the group.
In addition to sample selection bias, there are inductive bias and annotation bias.
There are various methods of data analysis, and even with the same data, the ""prediction"" results will vary depending on the method. Inductive bias is a bias that depends on the properties of the method used, and is difficult to avoid.
In addition, the types of data are not only numerical but also various such as voice and image, and when analyzing such data and using it for AI, annotations (data explanations) added by humans are often used as clues. Therefore, there is a bias depending on whether the annotation is believed or not.
The official name of the Personal Information Protection Law is the ""Act on the Protection of Personal Information."" This is a law aimed at protecting personal information. It does not simply restrict the use of information. The purpose is to protect the rights and interests of individuals. In other words, it is important to strike a balance between the protection of personal information and the utilization of personal information. The definition of ""personal information"" under this law is information about a living individual, and is defined as any of the following. Information that can identify a specific individual, such as name and date of birth (including information that can be easily compared with other information to identify a specific individual). Those containing personal identification codes. Computerized body characteristics (biological information). A code assigned when an individual uses a service or purchases a product.
In principle, analysis of personal information data is impossible without the consent of the data owner. There are three exceptions: When it is necessary to protect human life, body, or property. If it is possible to ""stop providing (opt out)"" at the person's intention, notify the person, and if the notification to the Personal Information Protection Commission is satisfied. If the information is anonymously processed.
Special care-required personal information is defined by government ordinance as the person's race, creed, social status, medical history, criminal record, crime victimization, and other information that may cause unfair discrimination and prejudice against the person. Special care-required personal information is ``prohibited in principle to acquire without obtaining the consent of the person''.
Personal information that has been processed so that individuals cannot be identified is called anonymously processed information. It is necessary to specify and publicize the fact that anonymously processed information will be provided to a third party, and simply hiding the name is not acceptable.
Of the public data held by administrative agencies (national and local governments), open data is open data that can be used for secondary purposes, is machine-readable, and can be used free of charge. In short, it is ""public data that is easy for citizens and companies to use."" The significance and purpose of open data is to solve various problems by promoting public participation and public-private collaboration, revitalize the economy, improve the sophistication and efficiency of administration, improve transparency and reliability, and solve local problems. mentioned.

The ideal situation is a census. A complete survey is to investigate all the subjects to be surveyed. A complete survey can be used when the environment for surveying the entire population is in place or when the size of the population is small.
The advantage of a complete survey is that the data obtained by the survey is true. On the other hand, the demerits of the census are that it is practically impossible to conduct a census in general statistical surveys and that the effort required for the survey is simply too great.

If a complete survey is impossible, a sample survey will be conducted. There are two methods of sampling, the superior sampling method and the random sampling method.
Significant sampling is the method by which survey planners select samples based on their own judgment. A typical example of significant sampling is convenience sampling.
The advantage of the significance extraction method is that the survey targets can be narrowed down ``by one's own judgment'', so data collection is easy. There are many. This is called sample selection bias. If the independent judgment is wrong, the result different from the truth may come out.
In order to collect data without introducing sample selection bias as much as possible, data should be selected directly from the population at random using a simple pure random sampling method. A multistage sampling method is also effective, in which a group is selected at random and samples are randomly sampled within the group.
Another common sample selection bias is trying to predict the future from already acquired data (=past data). In addition to the sample selection bias, there is also the recursive bias. Inductive bias is bias that depends on the properties of the method used.

Personal information is data that should be properly protected and is protected by the Personal Information Protection Law. Based on the fact that the proper and effective use of personal information is useful for the creation of industries, etc., the purpose is to protect the rights and interests of individuals, and the balance between the two is important.

In order to collect data without sample selection bias as much as possible, there are simple random sampling methods that select data directly from the population at random, and multistage sampling methods that randomly select groups and randomly sample within groups. be.
Other common sample selection biases include
・Predict the future from already acquired data (=past data)
・Presume grades after admission based on entrance exam scores
・Policies are determined based on a survey of all current employees
・Street media interviews
and so on.
Bias other than sample selection bias include:
・Inductive bias (bias dependent on the properties of the method used)
・Annotation bias (bias in human annotation (data explanation))

The Act on the Protection of Personal Information is officially called the Act on the Protection of Personal Information, and as the name suggests, it is a law aimed at protecting personal information. The purpose is not only to restrict the use of information, but also to protect the rights and interests of individuals based on the fact that the appropriate and effective use of personal information is useful for the creation of industries. A balance between the two is important
The definition of ""personal information"" under the Act on the Protection of Personal Information is information about a living individual that falls under any of the following
・Name, date of birth, etc. that can identify a specific individual (including information that can be easily compared with other information, thereby enabling identification of a specific individual)
・Items containing personal identification codes
・Electronized body characteristics (biological information) → Examples: DNA, facial features, iris, voiceprint, fingerprints, etc.
　　　・Code assigned when an individual uses a service or purchases a product → Example: passport number, driver's license number, resident card code, individual number
In principle, it is impossible to provide personal information to a third party without the consent of the data owner.
・Exception: When it is necessary to protect the life, body, or property of one person
・Exception 2 When all of the following conditions are met
・When it is possible to ""stop providing (opt out)"" at the will of the person. However, even if it is possible to opt out of special care-required personal information, provision to a third party is prohibited.
· Inform the person of the following
　　　· The purpose of use is to provide to a third party, the data items, and the method of provision
・What you can opt out of, and how to receive an opt-out
・Notification to the Personal Information Protection Commission
・Exception 3: If the information is anonymously processed

Special care-required personal information refers to the race, creed, social status, medical history, criminal history, facts of crime damage, and information requiring special care specified by government ordinance that may cause unfair discrimination and prejudice against the person. . Acquisition of special care-required personal information without the consent of the individual is prohibited in principle, and handling is particularly strict
Anonymously processed information is personal information that has been processed so that individuals cannot be identified. Also, just hiding the name is NG
Open data is public data held by administrative agencies (national and local governments) (not only governments, independent administrative agencies and local governments, but also private business operators and individuals such as public interest companies, and released in a form that can be used for secondary purposes. (including things)
1. Secondary use possible
2. suitable for machine reading
3. available free of charge
About public data
The significance and purpose of open data are as follows.
・Resolving various issues and revitalizing the economy by promoting public participation and public-private collaboration
・Sophistication and efficiency of administration
・Improve transparency and reliability
・Resolving local issues
・Policies should not be decided by the opinions of “loud people”, but should be decided based on objective analysis based on data (called Evidence-based policy making (EBPM)).
Pursuant to Article 11 of the Basic Act on the Promotion of Public and Private Sector Data Utilization (Law No. 103 of 2016), local governments are obliged to take necessary measures so that the public and private sector data they possess can be easily used by the public. Furthermore, in the 2017 Cabinet Decision on the “Declaration of the Creation of the World’s Most Advanced IT Nation and the Basic Plan for the Promotion of Public and Private Sector Data Utilization,” it is clearly stated that local governments will set a target of 100% open data initiatives by FY2020. rice field.
You can check the status of efforts by local governments regarding open data on the government CIO portal, and it is being used for disaster prevention, tourism, and child-rearing as an example of private sector utilization of local government open data.
In order to call it open data, it is necessary to 1. post the conditions for secondary use, 2. provide it in a format suitable for machine reading, and 3. provide it free of charge.
