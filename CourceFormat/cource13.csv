Next, there is a box plot, which is useful for comparing data distributions, and a pie chart, which is useful for showing the ratio of each data to the whole data. There is a graph, and it is effective in grasping the tendency between data points.All of these representation methods are effective, but by changing the distance between each data, the data can be expressed as desired. The drawback is that you can change the presentation, so it is important to take appropriate data.In addition, there are directed graphs and undirected graphs, and these are how to express friend relationships and people's behavior.

C-2021-1_U27,"""● Data... ① Facts that form the basis of reasoning about things. Materials and information that serve as a reference ② Materials that are symbolized and digitized to be processed by a computer using a program
● Visualization: Making data intuitively understandable
●Points to note in visualization... It is necessary to select an appropriate one according to the purpose and conditions ex. Just by changing the width of the vertical numbers in the bar graph, the price difference may appear to be large, or conversely, it may appear that there is almost no change. end up
●Visualization method
◎ Bar graph: effective when performing ""comparison"" of numerical data
　　◎Bar graph + error bar... You can express the spread of data with standard deviation
・Do not choose the origin of the vertical axis arbitrarily
◎Histogram: A diagram summarizing the number of times data was observed for each section. Useful for examining the ""distribution"" of data. (= I can understand ""what kind of value is there and how much"")
・Note that the appearance changes greatly depending on the width of the bin. A bin is a histogram bar. It is said that the width of the class (=bin width) should be about the square root of the total number of data.
・You can also compare multiple histograms
◎ Box plot... effective for ""comparing"" ""distribution""
・There are outliers
・ Quartiles... The median is less affected by outliers than the mean!
◎ Pie chart... effective when you want to see the ""proportion"" of each data to the whole
· 3D charts are easy to misunderstand, so it's better not to use them!
◎ Line graph... Effective when you want to know the ""trend of change"" between data
・It is inappropriate to connect unrelated data with lines
・Comparing line graphs... You have to make the vertical axis and width the same. So plot them on the same graph!
● Visualization of relationships...ex. Visualization of friendship relationships Represented by a matrix that means 1 if it is a friend
◎ Invalid graph: Express the relationship between data with points (nodes) and sides (edges). “Relationships/connections” between data
useful for understanding
・You can tell who is the central figure just by arranging the points (nodes)!
　◎Effective graph...A graph with a direction ex. 0 thinks 1 is a friend, but 1 doesn't
・Directed graph + color + map... Nodes represent locations, edges represent movement directions, and colors represent the amount of flow of people
● Scatter plot and two-dimensional histogram
◎ Scatter chart: Effective when you want to “know simultaneously” the “trends” of two types of data
・Scatter plot + color: 3 types of values ​​can be visualized by color
・Scatter charts are not suitable for large amounts of data
◎ Heat map: A diagram that expresses numerical values ​​by color. Useful for investigating ""distribution of two types of data""
・Heat map color…The impression and perspective will change greatly depending on this setting.
・Heat map + map: If it is geographical information, it is effective to overlay it on the map.
● Three or more types of elements cannot be displayed directly
◎ Visualization by removing elements ex. Scatter plot matrix, convert to data of two types of elements so that trends can be maintained
・ Large scatter = important for expressing data = do not cut
● Visualization also requires mathematics ex. Reduce the number of elements → Dimension reduction

C-2021-2_U41,"""Visualization is to make figures such as tables and graphs that are easy to interpret data. Also, a familiar example is to visualize the stock price situation by using a candlestick chart. It is also used to make AI predict future stock prices.Visualization makes it easy to convey data information to people and make it easy to understand.Visualization is especially useful in grasping a huge amount of data. However, it is necessary to be careful when visualizing, and it is necessary to select and use appropriate objects according to the purpose and conditions. For proper visualization, it is important to understand the effects of each visualization technique and when to use them appropriately.
For example, a typical visualization method is a bar graph. A bar graph is a graph in which data values ​​are represented by the height of bars, and is convenient for comparing numerical values. In particular, a combination of bar graphs and error bars can represent the spread of data. Here, error bars are standard deviations. It is important to note that the origin of the vertical axis of the bar graph should not be chosen arbitrarily. This can give the impression of being misunderstood or dishonest.
Then there is the histogram. This is effective when examining how the data are scattered for each interval. However, if the bin width is not set carefully, it may become difficult to grasp the trend or cause misunderstanding. You need to set the bin width so that you can properly convey what you want to convey to people. Histograms can also be used to compare multiple histograms, but this can be difficult to see. In such cases, a boxplot is more appropriate. Boxplots can be used to easily compare the distribution of data.
There are also pie charts. The ratio can be displayed by the area of ​​the circle, and the ratio of each data to the whole data can be read by looking at the area of ​​the circle. Pie charts can also be used to create three-dimensional figures, but if they are made three-dimensional, the relationship between the sizes of the areas will appear different, which may lead to misunderstandings. Therefore, when using a three-dimensional pie chart, it is necessary to enter actual numerical values, etc., and you must be very careful.
A line graph is also a representative example of a diagram for visualizing data. A line graph makes it easy to understand trends by connecting the points that show the data with lines. Lines in line graphs have the meaning of interpolating between points that were not observed, and it is meaningless to connect points showing unrelated data with lines. In a line graph, care must be taken to make sense when drawing lines. Also, when comparing line graphs, the width and range of the vertical axis must be the same. Failure to do so may create an impression of dishonesty or misunderstanding.
Next, let us consider the visualization of relationships. In an undirected graph, relationships between data can be represented by points and edges. Make it easier to recognize relationships and connections between data. In this graph, it is possible to make the relationship easier to recognize by devising the arrangement of the points. There are also directed graphs, which, unlike undirected graphs, use edges with arrows. By using a directed graph, it is possible to represent, for example, the flow of people.
Scatter charts are also useful for expressing the distribution and spread of data. A scatter diagram is simply a plot of points, and is a diagram that expresses data as a set of points on a plane. This makes it possible to grasp trends in two types of data simultaneously. In addition, a lot of information can be expressed by changing the color and shape of the dots. A two-dimensional histogram (heat map) is a diagram that expresses numerical values ​​by color using a scatter diagram. It is possible to represent the distribution of two types of data simultaneously represented. Data distribution can be made easier to understand by representing data for each grid. On the other hand, it is necessary to be careful with 2D histograms, as the appearance and impression may change depending on the color settings, which may lead to misunderstandings. It is necessary to think about color settings so that it is easy to convey.
As described above, it is necessary to carefully consider the capacity and effect of the visualization method and use it appropriately.
As described above, two types of data can be expressed, but three or more types of data cannot be expressed on paper. In order to represent three or more types of data on paper, there is a method of summarizing multiple data and using the summation to represent multiple scatter plots. It can also be expressed by reducing the number of elements. At this time, the accuracy of the data is relatively low, but by reducing the elements, it becomes possible to express it on paper.
At this time, the direction in which the data is more scattered is important, and it is important to set the direction in which the data is more scattered as the axis. Visualization of data in this way makes it easier to see and understand the data, which in some cases leads to policy decisions for data analysis.

One of the methods of grasping data trends by visualization There are scatter plots.Other visualization methods include histograms, box plots, bar charts, par charts, heat maps, line graphs, and undirected/directed graphs.Notes on visualization are appropriate depending on the purpose and conditions. It means you have to choose.
From here on, the visualization method will be shown in detail. The first is a bar graph. A bar graph is a diagram that expresses a value by the height of a bar. Some combine bar charts and error bars. In this method, the standard deviation can be used to express the spread of data. Also, the vertical axis of a bar chart should not be chosen arbitrarily. Some bar graphs represent frequencies. At this time, care must be taken because the bin width may change the appearance greatly. This histogram can be compared. The second is a boxplot. This diagram simply expresses the data distribution using the maximum value, minimum value, and quartiles, and is effective for comparing data distributions. A quartile is the number of positions that divides the entire data into four equal parts when the data is rearranged. The third is a pie chart. This is a diagram that displays the ratio by the area of ​​a circle, and it is effective when grasping the ratio of each data to the whole data. There are also 3D pie charts, but it is necessary to be careful because the size relationship of the area seems to be different when it becomes three-dimensional. The fourth is a line graph with straight lines connecting the data points. Lines in line graphs have the meaning of interpolating between points that were not observed. It is inappropriate to connect irrelevant data with lines. When comparing line graphs, care should be taken to ensure that the range and width of the vertical axis are the same. Also, when comparing, it is better to draw not the same graph drawing.
I will explain how to visualize the relationship. It can be visualized by displaying ""1"" if it is a friend and ""0"" if it is not in the visualization of friend relationships. There is also an undirected graph, which expresses relationships between data using points (nodes) and edges (edges). This graph is effective for grasping relationships and connections between data. By devising the placement of the points, it becomes easier to see. A graph in which one edge is directed is called a directed graph.
A scatter diagram is a diagram that expresses data as a set of points on a plane. This is effective when you want to grasp the trends of two types of data at the same time. Combining color and scatterplots, it is possible to visualize three types of values. However, when the amount of data is enormous, scatter plots are not suitable. A heat map is a diagram that uses colors to represent numerical values. Note that the color setting changes the impression even with the same data. This can be used overlaid on the map.
Scatter charts are best when 1 data = 2 dimensions. Three or more types of elements cannot be visualized. At this time, you can visualize it by picking up two elements and drawing a scatter plot for each. This is called a scatterplot matrix. Another method is to reduce the dimensionality by transforming the data into two types of element data so that the trend of the data can be preserved. At this time, a straight line is drawn in the direction in which the data scatter is large. When visualizing 4 or more types of data points, mathematically discover and visualize the direction in which the data is highly scattered.
As described above, visualization is a method for understanding data and supports intuitive understanding. Also, there are many types of visualization, and it is important to use them appropriately. In addition, by looking at the visualized data, it is possible to determine the policy for the next analysis. ""","""I learned about various visualization methods.

・There are various types of visualization. It is necessary to use them properly depending on the situation and purpose.
Bar graph: A diagram that expresses values ​​by the height of the bar. Useful when comparing numeric data. Depending on how the vertical axis is written, the wrong image can be given.
Histogram: A type of bar graph that aggregates the number of times data was observed for each section. It is useful to find out how many values ​​there are.
Boxplot: A diagram that simply expresses the data distribution with the maximum value, minimum value, and quartiles. Useful for comparing data distributions.
Pie chart: A diagram showing the ratio by the area of ​​a circle. Effective when knowing the ratio of each data to the whole. However, in the case of 3D pie charts, the size will differ from the actual size due to the perspective method, so you have to be careful.
Line graph: A diagram that connects data points with straight lines. Useful for understanding trends in change between data points.
Undirected graph: A diagram that expresses the relationship between data with points and edges. Effective for understanding the relationships and connections between data. Conversely, there are also directed graphs with a fixed direction.
Scatter diagram: A diagram representing data as a set of points on a plane. It is effective when you want to know the trends of two types of data at the same time.
Heat map: A diagram that expresses numerical values ​​by color. It is effective when checking what value exists in two types of data.
・Visualization when there are three or more elements can be done by erasing them.

However, on the other hand, there is a point to be noted that it is necessary to select an appropriate one according to the purpose and conditions. Specifically, inadequate visualization can create misunderstandings or create the impression of dishonesty. Therefore, it is necessary to grasp what effect each visualization method has and how to use it.

Visualization method below

·bar graph
It is a diagram in which values ​​are expressed by the height of bars, and is effective when comparing numerical data.
The origin of the vertical axis of the bar graph should not be chosen arbitrarily (∵ you can make the data look different)

・Bar graph + error bar
The standard deviation can express the distribution of data (often used together with the average value)

・Bar graph showing histogram (frequency)
A diagram summarizing the number of times data was observed for each interval, showing how many values ​​there are (=data distribution)
effective in examining Note that the width of each interval (bin) makes a big difference in appearance.

・Box plot
It is a diagram simply expressing the data distribution by the maximum value, the minimum value, and the quartile, and is effective when comparing the data distributions. The quartile is the number of positions that divide the entire data into four equal parts when the data values ​​are rearranged, and the median value is less affected by outliers than the mean value.

・Pie chart
It is a diagram showing a ratio by the area of ​​a circle, and is effective when grasping the ratio of each data to the whole data. However, in the case of 3D pie charts, it is necessary to be careful because the size of the area looks different due to the three-dimensional appearance.

·line graph
It is a diagram in which data points are connected by straight lines, and is effective in grasping trends in changes between data points.
Lines in line graphs are meant to interpolate between unobserved points, and it is inappropriate to connect irrelevant data with lines. When comparing line graphs, it is necessary to make the range and width of the vertical axis the same, so it is better to draw them in the same graph and compare them.

·Scatter plot
This diagram expresses data as a set of points on a plane, and is effective when it is desired to simultaneously grasp the trends of two types of data. """,,,,,-3

C-2022-1_U54,"""In this class, we learned about data visualization. Through visualization, we can intuitively understand things that we could not understand just by arranging numbers and sentences. Even if you look at it, you can't understand it at all, but by making it into a graph, you will be able to grasp the whole picture in an instant.With the graph, you will be able to grasp the trend.In addition to the graph, there are various visualization methods However, for visualization, it is necessary to select an appropriate one according to the purpose and conditions.Inappropriate visualization may cause quarrels or insincere insufficiency.The effect of each lyric or method may be affected. It is necessary to understand and use it appropriately by dividing it into TPOs.As this visualization method, there are histograms, bar graphs, pie charts, etc. A bar graph is a diagram that expresses values ​​by the height of bars, and it is a diagram that represents numerical data This is useful for comparisons.By adding error bars, you can express the spread of the data in terms of the standard deviation.The vertical axis of this bar graph can vary as much as you want by choosing the origin arbitrarily. A histogram is a bar graph that shows the frequency, and it is a diagram that aggregates the number of times data was observed for each interval. Because it can be seen at a glance, it is easy to examine the distribution of data.However, the appearance changes greatly depending on the setting of the bin width.It is also possible to compare these histograms themselves.The boxplot shows the data distribution. This is a simple representation of the maximum value, minimum value, and quartiles, which is useful for comparing data distributions.This quartile indicates that when the data values ​​are sorted, the overall data It is the number of positions that divides into four.A pie chart is a diagram that displays the ratio by the area of ​​a circle.It is effective when grasping the ratio of each data to the whole data.However, this A line graph is a diagram in which data points are connected by direct currents, and the relationship between data points is easily misunderstood. It is effective for grasping the trend of change.In this case, it is inappropriate to connect irrelevant data by twisting, because the line has the meaning of interpolating between points that were not observed. When comparing graphs, it is necessary to make the range and width of the vertical axis the same, so drawing them in the same graph makes it very easy to understand.
Next, visualize the relationship. Although it can be represented using numbers, it is easier to understand if it is represented by an undirected graph, which expresses data Kanno relationships with points and edges. This is effective in grasping relationships and connections between data. It will be easier to understand if you devise the placement of the points. If you add arrow information to this, direction information will be generated, and if you add information such as colors and maps to the effective graph that is called a directed graph, you can express the flow of people.
Scatterplots and two-dimensional histograms can visualize distributions and spreads. A scatter diagram is a diagram representing data as a set of points on one side. The trends of two types of data can be grasped at the same time. By adding color to this, we can visualize three kinds of values. However, when the number of data becomes enormous, the points overlap and the figure becomes unclear. A two-dimensional histogram, also called a heat map, is a diagram that expresses numerical values ​​using colors. You can find out what values ​​exist in two types of data. Depending on the color settings, even the same data can give a very different impression and perspective. However, when used well, it is useful for representing geographical information.
Scatter plots can be used to visualize multidimensional data. However, relationships between three or more types of elements cannot be displayed accurately. Therefore, if the number of elements is reduced and each type is represented by two types, three types of data can be represented even in a scatter diagram. It is called a scatterplot matrix, and in order to visualize three or more elements, you can combine elements two by two to create multiple scatterplots. In addition, by converting the data into untyped element data so as to maintain the trend of the data, it is possible to convert the data into data that maintains the spread of the data to some extent. For two types of elements, both the spread and trend of the data can be left on the graph. In the case of the three types of elements, the information to be expressed can be extracted and expressed by changing the focused information. A straight line and a plane can be determined by drawing a direct current in the direction in which the data are scattered more. Visualization of data with four or more elements can be done by numerically discovering and visualizing the directions in which the data are highly scattered.
Using these visualization techniques leads to policy decisions for data analysis. And visualization and analysis require mathematics.

Visualization is necessary because it is difficult to grasp the huge amount of data
When visualizing, grasp what kind of effect each visualization method has and when to use it so that inappropriate visualization does not create misunderstandings or give the impression of dishonesty.
A bar graph is a diagram that expresses values ​​using the height of bars, and is effective for comparing numerical data. The spread of the data can be expressed by the standard deviation with error bars. The origin of the vertical axis of the bar chart should not be chosen arbitrarily.
A histogram is a bar graph that expresses ""frequency (number of times)"", and is a diagram summarizing the number of times data was observed for each interval. Effective for examining data distribution. It should be noted that the bin width makes a big difference in appearance.
A boxplot is a simple representation of the data distribution using the maximum value, minimum value, and quartiles, and is effective for comparing data distributions.
A pie chart is a diagram that displays the ratio by the area of ​​a circle, and it is effective for grasping the ratio of each data to the whole data. 3D pie charts are easy to misunderstand because they look three-dimensional and have different size relationships.
A line graph is a diagram in which data points are connected by straight lines, and is effective for grasping trends in changes between data points. It is inappropriate to connect irrelevant data with lines, since lines in line graphs are intended to interpolate between points that were not observed. When comparing line charts, the range and width of the vertical axis must be the same.
An undirected graph is a diagram that expresses the relationship between data using points (nodes) and edges (edges), and is effective for understanding relationships and connections between data. You can make it easier to see by devising a method of arranging the points.
A directed graph is a graph with oriented edges. Combining colors and maps with a directed graph makes it possible to express locations by nodes, directions of people's movements by edges, and the amount of people's flow by colors.
A scatter diagram is a diagram that expresses data as a set of points on a plane, and is effective when you want to grasp the trends of two types of data at the same time. Many values ​​can be visualized by coloring them. By changing the shape and size of the dots, more information can be visualized at the same time. However, when the number of data is enormous, the scatter plot becomes unsuitable.
A heat map (two-dimensional histogram) is a diagram that expresses numerical values ​​by color, and is effective when examining what values ​​exist in two types of data. Even with the same data, impressions and views differ greatly depending on the color settings of the heat map. By combining it with a map, if it is geographical information, it is effective to overlay it on the map.
If 1 data = 2 dimensions, a scatter chart is the best, but even a scatter chart that summarizes data with more than 3 types of elements cannot express the data distribution. Therefore, if the number of elements can be reduced and the data can be expressed with two types of elements, it can be visualized. A scatterplot matrix can be created by combining elements by two to create multiple scatterplots to visualize more than two elements.
By looking at the visualized data, it leads to policy decisions for the next analysis.
