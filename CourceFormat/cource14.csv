The relationship between data can be represented by correlation and variance. When quantifying correlation, We use a numerical value called the correlation coefficient, which expresses the degree of correlation in the range of -1 to 1. Knowing the correlation coefficient allows us to imagine the shape of the data distribution.
Statistical testing is a framework for statistically evaluating differences, and as a way of thinking, it is assumed that there is no difference between two data, and it is judged whether the assumption is correct by comparing it with the significance level, which is the standard probability. . By applying this idea, it is possible to judge whether there is really a difference between the two means.
An image is data in which numerical values ​​are arranged regularly in two dimensions. Images can be used for image processing, object detection, recognition, segmentation, and three-dimensional reconstruction. Image analysis includes filtering.

A statistical test is a framework for showing the presence or absence of differences in data based on probability, even if the number of data is small. Statistical testing is a process of making a hypothesis and judging whether the probability of the hypothesis occurring exceeds a standard significance level.

Regression is a method of finding trends in data, and modeling relationships based on observed data using a formula that describes objective variables using explanatory variables.

As a method of correlation, which is a way to explain the relationship between two quantities, x1 and x2 are unrelated and uncorrelated, x1 → large, x2 → large positive correlation, x1 → large, x2 → small negative correlation There is correlation. The degree of correlation expressed by a real number in the range of -1 to +1 is called the correlation coefficient p. Mean value of the numerator (xy) of the correlation coefficient p. Also, if the data is not around the origin, the data should be translated and then calculated.　　　　　　
A distribution that shows what kind of data is available and how much. The distribution reveals the properties of the population. Variance, which expresses (= quantifies) the spread of data numerically, enables comparison of groups through quantification. Statistical evaluation using statistical tests, which is a framework for evaluating statistical strength, often reveals that the data obtained by observation is quantitatively insufficient, and that there are differences even in situations where data are limited. It's time to show.
・Basic idea of ​​statistical test
1 Consider the hypothesis that there is no difference (null hypothesis)
Believe in 2 hypotheses
3 Calculate the probability that it will happen based on past data
4 Compare with standard probability (significance level)
lower than standard
- Discard the null hypothesis
higher than standard

Regression analysis is a method of finding trends in given data. Modeling is the process of creating a simplified ""model"" of a phenomenon based on observations.
Let test scores be variables. From these, a relational expression between variables (data), which is a regression equation, is known. Regression analysis is an analytical method for obtaining relational expressions between data attributes, and is used for understanding phenomena and making predictions in unknown situations. If the data are temporally independent, the objective variable is described by the explanatory variable (= create a regression equation).
Regression method
The regression formula is a model in the form of y=ax+b, and a specific combination of a and b corresponds to one model. This calculates the values ​​of a and b from the data so that a straight line fits the data. As a method of model fitting, Σ i-th data fitting error → minimization or least squares method (squared error is (yi-(axi+b))^2, Σ(yi-(axi+b) )^2 is minimized). A point to note is overfitting (overfitting), which is well applied to observed data, but is often useless for unobserved cases = generalization ability (when calculating a regression curve, it was not in the data Whether a reasonable prediction result can be obtained for v (=unknown case) is low.

-The error for the data given in advance is large
polynomial approximation
＋The error against the data given in advance is small
-Regression results may not have the ability to generalize without a large amount of prior data

A major feature of time-series analysis, which is data observed over time, is that the order of observation has meaning. Generate a model with past data and predict future data from it.

Although the distribution does not represent everything, it is possible to see the spread of the data by looking at the distribution, and looking at the distribution is one of the most important things in data analysis. For example, the distribution of data can be seen by looking at variance. However, dispersion alone is not sufficient because it cannot discriminate detailed data. Therefore, we introduce the concept of 'correlation', which is a 'spread index' different from dispersion. This shows the relationship between the two quantities. Correlation can be obtained from the mean of the product of two quantities x and y and the variance of x and y, respectively. There are three types of correlation: ""no correlation"" where there is no relationship between two quantities, ""negative correlation"" where the other increases when one decreases, and ""positive correlation"" where the other increases when one increases. Considering this using the correlation coefficient, the values ​​are 0, negative, and positive, respectively. The sign of this correlation coefficient is determined by the average of the products of x and y representing two types of quantities, so this average is important. However, it should be noted that the slope of the straight line and the shape of the distribution that appear on the graph of the data cannot be understood only by the correlation coefficient.
Since it is difficult to completely collect data of sufficient quality, ""statistical tests"", which are frameworks for statistically evaluating differences, are often used. Statistical testing is to make a hypothesis (null hypothesis), consider the distribution of the population, and judge whether the hypothesis is correct based on whether the probability of the hypothesis occurring is higher or lower than the significance level. (You can see the importance of distribution here as well.) It can also be used to test whether there is a difference between two groups.
Regression analysis is an analysis method that obtains a relational expression between data attributes, and temporally independent data is used. Modeling is done in regression analysis. Modeling is to create a ""type"" that simplifies a phenomenon based on data. Also, create a regression equation that shows the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. By using this regression formula to determine a model and perform regression analysis, the relational expression between data can be found and data prediction can be made. We can also understand the phenomenon. The regression equation shows various models. For example, linear models. The error between the linear model and each data should be minimized. Therefore, the least squares method is used to minimize the sum of the squared errors between each data and the straight line. By the way, which is better, linear approximation or polynomial approximation? Since overfitting occurs in polynomial approximation, the generalization ability (whether the prediction for ungiven data is appropriate) is low for unobserved data, so it may be inferior to the linear model.

In regression analysis, there is a polynomial approximation to a linear approximation with a linear model expressed as a linear function.
In the former method, the least squares method is used, which is defined so that the total sum of fitting errors of each data is minimized.
In addition, although linear approximation has the ability to generalize, it does not fit as well as polynomial approximation.
Regression analysis with two or more explanatory variables is called multiple regression analysis, whereas the previous example is called simple regression analysis. In this case, the regression equation represents a plane rather than a straight line or curve.
Data observed over time is called time-series data. A feature of this data is that the order in which they are observed is significant.
Time-series data can be used to create autoregressive models and moving average models that use past data values ​​as explanatory variables, making it possible to analyze data and predict future data values.
For these model estimations, not only the least-squares method but also the maximum-likelihood estimation, in which the model is estimated by setting the parameters so as to most easily realize the observed values ​​obtained, is used.

However, it is necessary to look not only at the variance but also at another index called correlation. Correlation has no correlation, There are positive correlations and negative correlations.The degree of correlation expressed as a real number in the range of -1 to +1 is called the correlation coefficient.When there is negative correlation, the correlation function becomes negative, and when there is no correlation is close to 0, and the correlation coefficient is positive when there is a positive correlation.If you know the correlation coefficient, you can imagine the shape of the distribution a little.
A statistical test is a framework for evaluating statistical differences. have a basic idea
1. Hypothesis that there is no difference (making a null hypothesis)
2. believe the hypothesis
3. Calculate the probability that it will happen based on the data
4. Compare with standard probability (significance level)
There is a thing. When working with distributions, you need to think about how far you are from the mean. At this time, if the significance level is 5%, the null hypothesis can be rejected. Also, the lower the significance level, the more confident it can be rejected. This method can be used not only to compare a group and an individual, but also to test differences between two groups.
Regression analysis is an analysis method that finds a relational expression between data attributes. It is used when the data are temporally independent when understanding the phenomenon. In regression analysis, a regression formula is created and analyzed. As a method of regression, there is a model in which a regression formula called a linear model is ""y = ax + b"". Try to minimize the error when fitting the data to the model. The error at this time is defined as a square error by the method of least squares.
This section describes the precautions to be taken when performing regression analysis. First, we need to consider whether a linear approximation or a polynomial approximation is better. Overfitting is a phenomenon in which the falsifiability of less-observed data is reduced by overfitting to observed data. Linear approximation has the advantage of not causing severe overfeeding even if the number of prior data is small, and the disadvantage of having a large error with respect to the data given in advance. On the other hand, polynomial approximation has the advantage that the error with respect to the data given in advance is small, and the disadvantage that the regression results may not have the ability to generalize unless there is a large amount of prior data.
Time-series data is data that is observed over time. Time series analysis is a method useful for testing hypotheses and making predictions. Models for time series data include autoregressive models, moving average models, ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA. Estimation methods include least squares method and maximum likelihood estimation.

Regression analysis is an analysis method that finds a relational expression between data attributes. It is used when the data are temporally independent when understanding the phenomenon. In regression analysis, a regression formula is created and analyzed. As a method of regression, there is a model in which a regression formula called a linear model is ""y = ax + b"". Try to minimize the error when fitting the data to the model. The error at this time is defined as a square error by the method of least squares.
This section describes the precautions to be taken when performing regression analysis. First, we need to consider whether a linear approximation or a polynomial approximation is better. Overfitting is a phenomenon in which the falsifiability of less-observed data is reduced by overfitting to observed data. Linear approximation has the advantage of not causing severe overfeeding even if the number of prior data is small, and the disadvantage of having a large error with respect to the data given in advance. On the other hand, polynomial approximation has the advantage that the error with respect to the data given in advance is small, and the disadvantage that the regression results may not have the ability to generalize unless there is a large amount of prior data.
Time-series data is data that is observed over time. Time series analysis is a method useful for testing hypotheses and making predictions. Models for time series data include autoregressive models, moving average models, ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA. Estimation methods include least squares method and maximum likelihood estimation.

Image processing is general processing performed on images such as image quality correction and image composition, including brightness correction, area cutout, and composition.
　Object detection/object recognition is to recognize the position and category of an object in an image. The position is detected as a rectangular area and can be applied to autonomous driving and robots.
Region segmentation is the process of extracting a target region to be analyzed from an image, and it is determined whether each pixel belongs to the target region. It can be applied to plant growth modeling and autonomous driving systems.
　3D reconstruction is to restore 3D information from two or more images. It has a wide range of applications, including 3D modeling in real space, navigation systems, and AR applications.
Filtering is a grayscale conversion process that uses the number of pixels in an area of ​​an input image to obtain the value of one pixel of the output image. The value of one pixel in the smooth output image is calculated from the value of the pixel at the same position in the input image and the values ​​of the surrounding pixels.
A linear filter is a filtering process that sums (convolves) the multiplication of each element.
　By filtering, it is possible to perform smoothing to reduce grayscale variations contained in the image, and edge extraction to sharpen the image by extracting object boundary candidates and contour lines.
An averaging filter is equivalent to averaging the pixel values ​​within the area covered by the filter.
Weighted averaging is not a simple average value, but a weight that increases as the origin of the filter is closer. A Gaussian filter is one whose weights approximate a Gaussian distribution.
As a result of the averaging filter, the grayscale fluctuations are smoothed, but the image as a whole is blurred.
Non-linear filters can also preserve image edges, and there are median filters that output the median value in the region.
Edge extraction is the process of extracting parts (edges) in an image where the brightness changes abruptly. used as a pretreatment for Differential filter, Sobel filter, Laplacian filter, etc.
A differential filter is the difference between the target element and its adjacent pixels.
A Sobel filter is a method of extracting edges while suppressing noise. The differential filter also responds sensitively to noise. Noise is suppressed compared to the differentiation filter, and smooth edges are extracted.
A Laplacian filter is one that directly obtains direction-independent edges.
　Sharpening is to make the bright part brighter and the dark part darker on both sides of the edge part, and to make the slope of the edge steeper.
In the digitization of documents, when extracting word information from an image obtained by scanning a document, consider extracting character region candidates as preprocessing for information extraction.
Binarization is the process of classifying pixels into text and paper pixels based on the brightness of the pixels and converting them into a binary image of black (text) and white (paper). The setting of the threshold greatly influences the result of binarization. Depending on the setting of the threshold, characters can be written, and areas of paper may be misidentified as character area candidates. The threshold is automatically set based on the brightness distribution. It doesn't work well if the brightness distribution can't be divided into two peaks. Since binarization uses only brightness, unnecessary areas are extracted. Therefore, character features are learned from learning data, and character extraction and character recognition are performed simultaneously.
Correlation is a method of explaining the relationship between two quantities. In scientific analysis, it is used to know the presence or absence of causal relationships and relationships.
Correlation is a concept related to the relationship between two types of quantities. If uncorrelated, the two elements are irrelevant, if positively correlated, when one increases, the other increases, and if negatively correlated, when one increases, the other decreases. Correlation coefficient is the degree of correlation represented by a real number in the range of -1 to +1. If it is negative, there is negative correlation, if it is 0, there is no correlation, and if it is positive, there is positive correlation . If the data is not around the origin, it should be calculated after moving in parallel.
Statistical testing is a framework for statistically evaluating differences. Observed data are often quantitatively insufficient, and even in situations where data are limited, it is possible to confirm that there is a difference. Used when you want to show
The basic idea is to consider a hypothesis that there is no difference (null hypothesis), believe the hypothesis, calculate the probability that it will occur based on past data, and use the standard probability (significance level ) to compare with.
　Assuming that the distribution of the population is known as a probability distribution, and that the distribution is a normal distribution. Consider how far you are from the mean, and if you are on the edge, you can judge by the 5% significance level and reject it. At most 5% are wrong. If it's more on the edge, you can dismiss it with more confidence.
Extending this idea further, it is also possible to test whether there is a difference between the two groups. This technique is very often used when verifying the presence or absence of an effect. """,,,,,-3

Filtering is a grayscale conversion process that uses the pixel values ​​in a certain area of ​​the input image to obtain the value of one pixel in the output image. It is calculated from the value and the values ​​of pixels around it. Smoothing and edge extraction can be performed by filtering. Linear filters, such as averaging filters and weighted averaging filters, can be used to reduce unwanted grayscale variations in images, but they also have the drawback of blurring the entire image. Therefore, by using an edge-preserving averaging filter, which is a nonlinear filter, the image can be smoothed without blurring. Edge extraction is a process of extracting portions (edges) in an image where the brightness changes abruptly using a differential filter, Sobel filter, or Laplacian filter.
Binarization is the process of converting an image into a binary image of black (character) and white (paper), and it is possible to convert a document into data by extracting character area candidates through binarization.

Correlation is a way of describing the relationship between two quantities, and is an indicator of how spread out data is with variance.
