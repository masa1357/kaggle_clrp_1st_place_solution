My first-hand experience of the wonders of AI
There is a card game app for smartphones called ZENONZARD, and in this game you form a team with an AI to advance the game.
The cool thing about this game is that the AI ​​learns from the player. For example, an AI paired with an aggressive player will adopt an aggressive strategy, and conversely, an AI paired with a player with a conservative strategy will become conservative.
Depending on the deck type, the AI ​​left a better record than the human, and the playing was also quite human.
Trading card games have exponential combinations of cards in relation to the number of cards.

Artificial intelligence is used in everyday life and is playing an important role in daily life and economic activities. Making artificial intelligence learn so that it can produce appropriate output for input is to adjust parameters well. This is called machine learning, and it requires a sufficient amount of data and a rich variety of data. AI, which can handle complex tasks, repeatedly multiplies and adds various numbers to the input and outputs it. Behind the dramatic improvement in AI performance are the use of deep neural networks, the availability of large-scale data, and the increased power of computers. Further spurring this is the open strategy, and further improvements in performance are expected. However, current AI is not omnipotent, and it is necessary to overcome problems such as hostile cases, frame problems, and unclear grounds for judgment. ""","I learned that ""having a correlation"" does not mean the same thing as ""having a causal relationship between two pieces of data.""

I also learned that finding trends is utilized in corporate strategies, etc., and that grasping the group roughly leads to efficiency improvement in thinking about the whole.
As for AI, I learned that at the current stage, it can only do things in line with one theme, and that it needs someone to teach it to learn. On the other hand, I was able to know that it is used in various aspects of our daily lives and plays a major role in reducing labor costs and labor and improving efficiency.

C-2021-2_U125,"""The basics of data analysis, discovering trends and associations, and classifying and grouping them. AI and machine learning.""","""Discovery is a method of finding trends hidden in large-scale data. Typical methods for discovery include correlation analysis and frequent pattern discovery. Correlation indicates the strength of a trend. Yes, there are positive correlations, negative correlations, and non-correlations, but we have to be careful because there are also ""pseudo-correlations"" that only appear to be causal. There is a so-called basket analysis for frequent pattern discovery, which is also applied to the analysis of questionnaire results. Classification/grouping is to divide data into several groups, which makes it easier to grasp the whole data. When classifying, groups may or may not be determined in advance, and when determined in advance, combinations and hierarchies are possible. For undetermined cases, ""clustering"" is effective to make similar groups into similar groups. However, there are problems with clustering, and one of the first things that can be mentioned is the difficulty in determining criteria for “similar”.
Next, about AI and machine learning. AI is a machine that imitates human intelligence, and there are “specialized AI” that can only do specific things, and strong “general-purpose AI” that has flexibility and multifunctionality like our intelligence. Familiar AI is used in various situations such as ""Siri"", ""chatbot"", ""face recognition"", ""image diagnosis"", ""medical diagnosis"", and ""distribution of recommendations and advertisements"". In relation to games, ""IBM Watson"", ""Computer Shogi"", ""AlphaGo"", etc. In relation to business, there are ""sharing economy"", ""recommendation of products"", ""customer surveillance"", and ""digital transformation"". Machine learning is necessary to strengthen AI, and machine learning enables ""prediction"", ""recognition/classification"", and ""generation"". For machine learning, it is necessary to have a lot of data, and even if there is a lot of data, the data must not be similar. In addition, there are two types of machine learning: ""supervised"" and ""unsupervised."" ""Supervised"" means that humans give correct answers to data in advance. Grouping is effective for unsupervised machine learning, and the “clustering” we discussed in the data analysis session corresponds to unsupervised learning. About ""deep neural networks"" that can realize extremely high-performance AI through large amounts of data and learning. It can be used for various tasks such as prediction, recognition, and generation. The reasons for the recent dramatic improvement in AI performance are the use of deep neural networks, the availability of large-scale data, and the improvement in computer performance. What is accelerating the boom is what is called an ""open strategy,"" and the fact that anyone can develop and research AI-related things for free is behind the boom. However, current AI is by no means omnipotent, and only specialized AI has been realized. There are problems such as ambiguity.

This data is quantitative data. (ratio data, interval data) and qualitative data (rank data and categorical data).In addition, data is structured data (data that can be expressed in tabular form) and unstructured data (data that is not in tabular form). Analyzing data in order to extract meaningful information from the data.It is impossible to extract meaningful information without using an appropriate analytical method.From an academic and social point of view, objectivity and reproduction It is necessary to have a valid basis, and it is necessary to express the basis as a numerical value.Therefore, the demand for data analysis is increasing.In addition, data analysis is necessary because the data is large-scale, complex, and diversified. In order to analyze data, we can see progress in data analysis technology, such as increasing the scale of computer resources, progress in numerical analysis methods, machine learning, open sourcing, free libraries, and technical commentary sites. The main tasks are prediction, discovery (of trends and associations), and classification/grouping.
We make predictions around us. For example, in diagnosing and making recommendations, we routinely make predictions about the future. Create a prediction model when making predictions using data. If this prediction model can be made, it will be possible to predict situations that have never existed in the past based on past experience. Various prediction models are conceivable, and prediction results and accuracy differ depending on the model. And even with the same predictive model, there are many ways to fit the data. It is important to choose an appropriate prediction model, and it is necessary to apply the prediction model appropriately to the data so that as many data as possible can be predicted accurately. However, it is still difficult to make predictions from the perspective of the difference between the current situation and the time of prediction, the uncertainty of the factors that determine the forecast results, which forecast model to use, and the need to collect sufficient past data. It's getting harder to do
Another task in data analysis is discovery (trends and associations). Discovery is a method of finding trends hidden in large-scale data, and typical methods for discovery include correlation analysis and frequent pattern discovery. Correlation refers to when the trends of increase and decrease of A and B are similar. Correlations are strong. In other words, trends have strength. When plotting a graph with A and B as the axes, points are scattered when the correlation is weak. If A increases, B also increases, or if A increases, B decreases (linear relationship), so when the correlation is strong, they line up in a straight line. When A increases, B also tends to increase, we say that the positive correlation is strong, and when A increases, B tends to decrease, we say that the negative correlation is strong. No relationship is called no correlation. A straight line cannot be drawn when there is no correlation. When performing correlation analysis, one must beware of spurious correlations. Although they appear to be correlated, they are not necessarily correlated. In addition, even if there is a correlation, it is unclear which of the two events is the cause or the effect, because the causality cannot be known from the correlation alone. Correlation analysis must be done with these things in mind.
In frequent pattern discovery, basket analysis is performed. In basket analysis, for example, items purchased at the same time by each purchaser are compared to find out which combination is the most common. This is often used when analyzing trends in survey results.
Another task in data analysis is classification/grouping. Grouping is dividing data into several groups. Grouping makes it easier to grasp the situation of the entire data. This makes it possible to combine and hierarchize data. Clustering is very often used when the groups are not predetermined. The purpose of clustering is to automatically form groups by ensuring that similar data are in the same group. Here, a cluster means ""a cluster of similar data"". The difference between clustering and grouping is that clustering does not directly define groups, it just separates groups. The number of clusters formed indicates the diversity of the entire data, and the number of data in each cluster indicates the power of each cluster. In addition, it is possible to overview the whole by looking at representative examples of each group. However, there are many points to consider in clustering. It is necessary to think carefully about what it means to have ""similar data"" in clustering. For example, we need to think about what is similar, where on earth we should focus, how similar we are, and how we measure and calculate the degree of similarity. This ""method for measuring the degree of similarity"" has not been uniquely determined, there are various ways to determine the number of clusters, and the index has not been determined, so in many cases there is no absolute answer for clustering. . Therefore, it can be seen that using mathematical data analysis does not give a single answer.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a machine that imitates human intelligence. All artificial intelligence (AI) currently in use is AI that artificially realizes only specific intelligence, that is, specialized AI, which is AI that can only do specific things. Specific AI is called ``weak AI'' because it can only do certain things. On the other hand, general-purpose AI is a 'strong AI' that has the same flexibility and multi-functionality as our intelligence, but at present it is still in the examination stage, and it is not possible to define what kind of AI is strong AI. is. One method for realizing general-purpose AI is called ""whole-brain simulation,"" which reproduces the movements of individual neurons that make up the brain and connects them to reproduce the entire brain. We also have artificial intelligence such as Siri, image recognition, face recognition, recommendation and advertisement distribution, and medical diagnosis. There are also examples of AI beating professionals in games.
AI is also used in the sharing economy. The sharing economy is a new economic movement in which individuals share (rent, buy, sell, or provide) via an Internet platform. These five sharing targets are places, vehicles, things, people, skills, and money. Here, AI is used to predict where, when, and what kind of sharing request will come, optimally allocate resources to be shared, and automatically determine usage prices according to supply and demand. be. Also, based on the purchasing behavior and browsing history data of various people, AI may predict products and articles that a specific person may be interested in and recommend products. AI is also used to monitor customers by placing cameras in stores and towns to observe the movement of people and things, and to monitor river flooding and traffic congestion. And AI is also used for digital transformation (DX). This DX is to improve the efficiency of business and various organizations by various information processing technologies including AI. It is believed that DX will be used extensively in office work in the future.
AI learns like humans. In the case of AI, it is necessary to prepare many examples of output for input and adjust AI so that it can output exactly as it is, which is called machine learning. Machine learning includes, for example, ""prediction"", ""recognition/classification"", and ""generation"" such as creating new data that did not exist in the world from various existing data. Note that this machine learning requires a rich variety of data and a sufficient amount of data. If there is not enough data, it will not be able to perform well even if it learns, and even if there is a lot of data, it will not be possible to learn sufficiently if all the data are similar.
Let's take a closer look at AI. AI is the function y=f(x). And machine learning is a method of transforming the function y=f(x) into a desired form by data. When you transform the function, you transform the parameters. Transforming the parameters changes the shape of the function, and the performance also changes.
The current mainstream AI is a deep neural network. With large amounts of data and learning (called deep learning), we have been able to realize extremely high-performance AI, which can be used for various tasks such as prediction, recognition, and generation. A deep neural network repeats “multiplying” and “adding” various numbers to the input data many times to come up with the final answer. These ""various numbers"" are parameters, and it is necessary to appropriately set these parameters through learning.
The reason why AI has evolved dramatically recently and is touted is the use of this deep neural network, the availability of extremely large-scale data, and the improvement in computer performance. A deep neural network requires a large amount of data because of the huge number of parameters, but computers and the Internet have made it possible, and the improvement in computer performance has made it possible to learn this deep neural network. There is an open strategy that further accelerates the above three factors, and open strategies include open source, open data, and computers that can be used for free. It accelerated the development of AI because it created an environment that everyone could use. However, current AI is not omnipotent. Current AI is a specialized type, not a general type, so it can only do specific things. Also, it doesn't work properly without enough data. And AI has many problems. For example, an adversarial case of making an error that a human would never make. This problem means that AI is inflexible about what it has not learned. In addition, there is also the frame problem that ""thinking is limited to a specific range"". Furthermore, it is difficult to find the grounds for judgment with AI. Currently, there is a lot of research on explainable AI to solve this problem, where you can understand what the AI ​​is based on.

When you transform the function, you transform the parameters. Transforming the parameters changes the shape of the function, and the performance also changes.
The current mainstream AI is a deep neural network. With large amounts of data and learning (called deep learning), we have been able to realize extremely high-performance AI, which can be used for various tasks such as prediction, recognition, and generation. A deep neural network repeats “multiplying” and “adding” various numbers to the input data many times to come up with the final answer. These ""various numbers"" are parameters, and it is necessary to appropriately set these parameters through learning.
The reason why AI has evolved dramatically recently and is touted is the use of this deep neural network, the availability of extremely large-scale data, and the improvement in computer performance. A deep neural network requires a large amount of data because of the huge number of parameters, but computers and the Internet have made it possible, and the improvement in computer performance has made it possible to learn this deep neural network. There is an open strategy that further accelerates the above three factors, and open strategies include open source, open data, and computers that can be used for free. It accelerated the development of AI because it created an environment that everyone could use. However, current AI is not omnipotent. Current AI is a specialized type, not a general type, so it can only do specific things. Also, it doesn't work properly without enough data. And AI has many problems. For example, an adversarial case of making an error that a human would never make. This problem means that AI is inflexible about what it has not learned. In addition, there is also the frame problem that ""thinking is limited to a specific range"". Furthermore, it is difficult to find the grounds for judgment with AI. Currently, there is a lot of research on explainable AI to solve this problem, where you can understand what the AI ​​is based on.

C-2021-2_U41,"""Data refers to the facts that form the basis of reasoning about things, materials and information that serve as a reference, and materials that are coded and digitized to be processed using programs on a computer. This data is quantitative data. (ratio data, interval data) and qualitative data (rank data and categorical data).In addition, data is structured data (data that can be expressed in tabular form) and unstructured data (data that is not in tabular form). Analyzing data in order to extract meaningful information from the data.It is impossible to extract meaningful information without using an appropriate analytical method.From an academic and social point of view, objectivity and reproduction It is necessary to have a valid basis, and it is necessary to express the basis as a numerical value.Therefore, the demand for data analysis is increasing.In addition, data analysis is necessary because the data is large-scale, complex, and diversified. In order to analyze data, we can see progress in data analysis technology, such as increasing the scale of computer resources, progress in numerical analysis methods, machine learning, open sourcing, free libraries, and technical commentary sites. The main tasks are prediction, discovery (of trends and associations), and classification/grouping.
We make predictions around us. For example, in diagnosing and making recommendations, we routinely make predictions about the future. Create a prediction model when making predictions using data. If this prediction model can be made, it will be possible to predict situations that have never existed in the past based on past experience. Various prediction models are conceivable, and prediction results and accuracy differ depending on the model. And even with the same predictive model, there are many ways to fit the data. It is important to choose an appropriate prediction model, and it is necessary to apply the prediction model appropriately to the data so that as many data as possible can be predicted accurately. However, it is still difficult to make predictions from the perspective of the difference between the current situation and the time of prediction, the uncertainty of the factors that determine the forecast results, which forecast model to use, and the need to collect sufficient past data. It's getting harder to do
Another task in data analysis is discovery (trends and associations). Discovery is a method of finding trends hidden in large-scale data, and typical methods for discovery include correlation analysis and frequent pattern discovery. Correlation refers to when the trends of increase and decrease of A and B are similar. Correlations are strong. In other words, trends have strength. When plotting a graph with A and B as the axes, points are scattered when the correlation is weak. If A increases, B also increases, or if A increases, B decreases (linear relationship), so when the correlation is strong, they line up in a straight line. When A increases, B also tends to increase, we say that the positive correlation is strong, and when A increases, B tends to decrease, we say that the negative correlation is strong. No relationship is called no correlation. A straight line cannot be drawn when there is no correlation. When performing correlation analysis, one must beware of spurious correlations. Although they appear to be correlated, they are not necessarily correlated. In addition, even if there is a correlation, it is unclear which of the two events is the cause or the effect, because the causality cannot be known from the correlation alone. Correlation analysis must be done with these things in mind.
In frequent pattern discovery, basket analysis is performed. In basket analysis, for example, items purchased at the same time by each purchaser are compared to find out which combination is the most common. This is often used when analyzing trends in survey results.
Another task in data analysis is classification/grouping. Grouping is dividing data into several groups. Grouping makes it easier to grasp the situation of the entire data. This makes it possible to combine and hierarchize data. Clustering is very often used when the groups are not predetermined. The purpose of clustering is to automatically form groups by ensuring that similar data are in the same group. Here, a cluster means ""a cluster of similar data"". The difference between clustering and grouping is that clustering does not directly define groups, it just separates groups. The number of clusters formed indicates the diversity of the entire data, and the number of data in each cluster indicates the power of each cluster. In addition, it is possible to overview the whole by looking at representative examples of each group. However, there are many points to consider in clustering. It is necessary to think carefully about what it means to have ""similar data"" in clustering. For example, we need to think about what is similar, where on earth we should focus, how similar we are, and how we measure and calculate the degree of similarity. This ""method for measuring the degree of similarity"" has not been uniquely determined, there are various ways to determine the number of clusters, and the index has not been determined, so in many cases there is no absolute answer for clustering. . Therefore, it can be seen that using mathematical data analysis does not give a single answer.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a machine that imitates human intelligence. All artificial intelligence (AI) currently in use is AI that artificially realizes only specific intelligence, that is, specialized AI, which is AI that can only do specific things. Specific AI is called ``weak AI'' because it can only do certain things. On the other hand, general-purpose AI is a 'strong AI' that has the same flexibility and multi-functionality as our intelligence, but at present it is still in the examination stage, and it is not possible to define what kind of AI is strong AI. is. One method for realizing general-purpose AI is called ""whole-brain simulation,"" which reproduces the movements of individual neurons that make up the brain and connects them to reproduce the entire brain. We also have artificial intelligence such as Siri, image recognition, face recognition, recommendation and advertisement distribution, and medical diagnosis. There are also examples of AI beating professionals in games.
AI is also used in the sharing economy. The sharing economy is a new economic movement in which individuals share (rent, buy, sell, or provide) via an Internet platform. These five sharing targets are places, vehicles, things, people, skills, and money. Here, AI is used to predict where, when, and what kind of sharing request will come, optimally allocate resources to be shared, and automatically determine usage prices according to supply and demand. be. Also, based on the purchasing behavior and browsing history data of various people, AI may predict products and articles that a specific person may be interested in and recommend products. AI is also used to monitor customers by placing cameras in stores and towns to observe the movement of people and things, and to monitor river flooding and traffic congestion. And AI is also used for digital transformation (DX). This DX is to improve the efficiency of business and various organizations by various information processing technologies including AI. It is believed that DX will be used extensively in office work in the future.
AI learns like humans. In the case of AI, it is necessary to prepare many examples of output for input and adjust AI so that it can output exactly as it is, which is called machine learning. Machine learning includes, for example, ""prediction"", ""recognition/classification"", and ""generation"" such as creating new data that did not exist in the world from various existing data. Note that this machine learning requires a rich variety of data and a sufficient amount of data. If there is not enough data, it will not be able to perform well even if it learns, and even if there is a lot of data, it will not be possible to learn sufficiently if all the data are similar.
Let's take a closer look at AI. AI is the function y=f(x). And machine learning is a method of transforming the function y=f(x) into a desired form by data.

C-2021-2_U8,"""Discovery of trends and relationships is the basis of data analysis. Discovery is a method of finding trends hidden in large-scale data. Representative methods for discovery include correlation analysis and frequent pattern discovery. The first is correlation analysis: when there is a tendency that ""as A increases, B also increases"", it is said that ""A and B are correlated"". Correlation has strength, and when the trend is strong, the correlation is strong, and when the trend is weak, the correlation is weak. When considering correlations, beware of spurious correlations that appear spectacular. Also, be aware of the difference between correlation and causation. Basket analysis is available for frequent pattern discovery, and it can also be applied to analysis of questionnaire results. The basics of data analysis, next is classification and grouping. Grouping is dividing data into several groups. If groups are determined in advance, combinations and hierarchies are also possible, and if groups are not determined in advance, similar data are clustered so that they belong to the same group, and groups are automatically formed. From the clustering results, we can see the overall overview from the diversity of the data as a whole, the power of each cluster, and representative examples. However, on the other hand, the definition of data similarity is not clear. Another disadvantage of clustering is that there is often no absolute correct answer for clustering.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is an opportunity to imitate human intelligence. Human intelligence performs many things, such as prediction, discovery, pattern recognition, solving mathematical problems, and conversation. Specialized AI is an AI that artificially realizes only a specific type of intelligence. However, in other words, the AI ​​can only do specific things. This AI is also called weak AI because it is not intelligent enough to think about something. All AI in use today is specialized AI. General-purpose AI has the flexibility and versatility of humans, and is also called strong AI. However, this is still under consideration. One method for achieving this is an “omnipotent simulation”. Artificial intelligence is all around us. Examples include Siri, chatbots, face recognition, image recognition, medical diagnosis, recommendation and advertisement delivery. As for the history of games and artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence has beaten humans in quiz shows, computer shogi, and go. AI-based businesses include sharing economy, product recommendation, customer monitoring, and digital information. Machine learning is used to create artificial intelligence. In machine learning, prepare a lot of examples for AI and make it output as it is (supervised machine learning). Machine learning enables prediction, recognition/classification, generation, etc. It is important that the data used during machine learning is not sufficiently similar in quantity. Since AI is a function, machine learning is about shaping a function with data. Things like the coefficients of a function are called parameters. The mainstream AI these days is a deep neural network, which can be used for various tasks. The reasons for the recent dramatic improvement in deep networks are the use of deep networks, large-scale data, and the performance of computers. There is also an open strategy that further accelerates the above reasons. However, current AI is not omnipotent. Only the specialized type has been realized, and there is a problem that it does not work properly without sufficient data. Other problems include inability to discriminate due to noise, consideration of only a specific range, and difficulty in finding the basis for judgment.

Also, correlation and causal relationships In classification and grouping, the method differs depending on whether the group is predetermined or not.In the case of predetermined, there are combinations and hierarchies, etc. If not, there is clustering that automatically configures the groups.
Artificial intelligence can be divided into specialized AI and general-purpose AI, but currently only specialized AI exists. Specialized AI is familiar to us, and it is used in the form of image recognition, voice recognition, sharing economy, surveillance, digital transformation, etc. in the business field. Also, when creating artificial intelligence, there is a thing called machine learning (manipulating the shape (parameters) of a function into a desired shape), which enables prediction, recognition/classification, and generation. Among machine learning AI, the most popular recently is a deep neural network, which has extremely high performance. However, there are problems such as the existence of current hostile cases, frame problems, and unclear grounds for judgment.

C-2021-2_U9,"""The main methods of 'discovery' to find trends hidden in a huge amount of data are correlation analysis and frequent pattern discovery. Correlation analysis is a method to clarify the relationship between two elements. If the relationship between elements is strong, the correlation is strong, and if the relationship is weak, the correlation is weak. Correlation includes ""positive correlation"", ""negative correlation"", and ""non-correlation"". ""Positive correlation"" occurs when a increases and b also increases, ""negative correlation"" occurs when a increases and b decreases, and ""no correlation"" occurs when there is no relationship. In the case of correlation analysis, two points must be noted: ""pseudo-correlation"" and ""causation and correlation are different things"". An example of frequent pattern analysis is basket analysis. Basket analysis is a method of analyzing what other consumers who purchased a specific product also purchased.
Grouping is to divide data into multiple groups, which makes it easier to grasp the situation of the entire data. To automatically form a group by making similar data belong to the same group when the group is not determined in advance. This is called clustering. A group of similar data is called a cluster. Clustering allows us to get an overview of the whole, and we can also understand the diversity of the whole data and the power of each cluster. While clustering is used in various situations, there are many points to consider, such as what it means to say that data are similar. In addition, there are many different ways to measure ""similarity"" and determine the number of clusters, so there is often no absolute correct answer for clustering.
AI is a machine that imitates human intelligence, and there are many things that use AI around us. All AIs in use today are specialized AIs. Specialized AI, also known as “weak AI,” is an AI that is artificially created with only specific intelligence. AI can be used for the sharing economy, recommending products to consumers, improving the efficiency (DX) of businesses and various organizations, and can also be used to monitor people, things, rivers and traffic conditions. Such AI will be able to produce correct output for input through machine learning. AI can be expressed as a function y=f(x) because it outputs for input. (Supervised) machine learning is to prepare a lot of correct output data for input and adjust AI so that it outputs accordingly. It is to be. In this case, a sufficient amount of various data is required. This machine learning will enable AI to predict, generate, recognize and classify.
Deep neural networks are at their core in modern AI. A deep neural network is a multi-layered mathematical model of a human brain neural circuit that enables the extraction of various features. In a deep neural network, the final answer is obtained by repeatedly multiplying and adding parameters to the input data. Utilization of this network, acquisition of large-scale data, and increased computer power have dramatically improved AI performance. Also, with the advent of open source, open data, and computers that can be used free of charge from the web, the performance of AI is likely to improve further.
However, current AI is not omnipotent, and has many weaknesses, such as ``no flexibility for things that have not been learned'' and ``it can only think about a specific range''.
On the other hand, general-purpose AI, which is currently under consideration, is also called “strong AI” and has the same flexibility and multi-functionality as human intelligence. As a method to realize this general-purpose AI, there is a ""whole brain simulation"" that reproduces the movement of individual neurons that make up the brain and connects them to reproduce the entire brain.

C-2021-2_U91,"""Discovery is to find trends hidden in a large amount of data, and typical methods are correlation analysis and frequent pattern discovery. First of all, regarding correlation analysis, ``If A increases, B will also increase.'' When there is a tendency such as ""When A decreases, B decreases"", it is said that ""A and B are correlated"". A strong tendency is called ""strong correlation"", and a weak tendency is called ""weak correlation"". Here, when finding correlations, one must beware of spurious correlations. For example, there seems to be a correlation between height and academic ability in mathematics at first glance, but it is only an apparent correlation due to the factor of grade. Furthermore, correlation and causation are different. A causal relationship refers to a relationship such as ``This result is due to this cause.'' However, even if there is a correlation between A and B, it is not clear which of A or B is the cause and which is the effect.
Next, I will talk about frequent pattern discovery. There are several methods for frequent pattern discovery. First, searching for combinations of products that are often bought together when shopping is called ""basket analysis,"" and this can also be applied to analysis of questionnaire results. Next, dividing data into several groups is called ""grouping"", and it is possible to grasp the situation of the entire data by looking at each group. If the group is pre-determined, a combination or seaweed is possible. However, if the groups are not pre-determined, groups are automatically formed by placing similar data in the same group. This is called clustering.
