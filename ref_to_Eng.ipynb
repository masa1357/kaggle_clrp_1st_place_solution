There are various methods of expression depending on the object. In the case of a vector, which is a combination, you can see the relationship between data by preparing a lot of data, even if you can't understand it with one combination.And in data analysis, you can see whether the data are similar or not. Whether it is close or far is important.Distance in data analysis means the difference between data.Similarity is the opposite concept of distance, meaning that the greater it is, the more similar it is.The more strictly the distance is defined do not have.\\r\\nThere are multiple ways to express the distance between data.

First of all, there is a bar graph as the first method, which is effective when comparing numerical data.Next, there is an error bar, which shows the degree of dispersion of data.Next, there is a histogram, which shows the frequency. Next, there is a box plot, which is useful for comparing data distributions, and a pie chart, which is useful for showing the ratio of each data to the whole data.

Unstructured data processing consists of language processing, image processing, and audio processing. one was mentioned.\\r\\nFirst of all, regarding language data, language data is data represented by character strings. On the other hand, there is a technique of analyzing by a computer called natural language processing. Examples include frequent language (the process of finding the most frequently occurring word in language data), translation, retrieval, summarization, and dialogue. These deal with just strings, but some deal with the semantics of strings as well. Examples include semantic analysis (quantifying each word or sentence according to its meaning), paraphrase analysis (does the meaning of the sentence be the same even though the words are different?), and sentiment analysis (guessing the emotions hidden in the sentence). ), sentence generation, etc.\\r\\nNext is the image data, but an image can be viewed as a vector. A numerical value is assigned to each color. For example, an image of 4 million pixels is a vector of 4 million dimensions. In other words, \\\"creating an image\\\" means \\\"creating a vector\\\", and adjusting the appearance of an image means \\\"manipulating a vector\\\". There are many challenges in analyzing image data, including image recognition, computer vision, image processing, image generation, and feature extraction.\\r\\nFinally, regarding audio data, sound is a \\\"wave\\\", and it can be converted into data by quantifying its height. Sound can be broadly classified into three categories: human voice, music, and environmental sound. Examples of speech (human voice) analysis include speech recognition, speaker recognition, emotion recognition, and speech synthesis. Examples of music data analysis include music analysis, automatic composition, acoustic analysis, and music recognition. Examples of environmental sound data analysis include environmental sound recognition, sound source separation (separating multiple sounds), sound source identification (where the sound comes from), and abnormal sound detection.\\r\\nThe method of guessing \\\"what\\\" is called pattern recognition. Humans do this on a daily basis, but it is difficult for computers. Since the computer cannot freely recognize anything, the object that can be recognized is decided in advance as a premise. A pattern recognizer designed for animals cannot recognize automobiles, and a pattern recognizer designed for automobiles cannot recognize animals. At present, there are only such specialized recognizers, and they are becoming familiar to us, such as face recognition, meal recognition, voice recognition (smart speakers), and character recognition (zip code recognition).\\r\\n\\\"Similar\\\" is the key word for the basic principle of computer pattern recognition. However, as we learned in the previous lecture, \\\"similar\\\" is very ambiguous (\\\"where\\\", \\\"how much\\\", etc.) and difficult. Therefore, it is necessary for AI to perform machine learning using a large amount of data. Draw a boundary line in the large amount of prepared data, and when it is done, recognize which side of the boundary line the object is on. Recently, many of them are based on deep neural networks. A simple image of pattern recognition in a deep neural network is to cut (drawing a boundary line) something that is difficult to separate (the boundary line is difficult to draw) by devising the situation on the side that can be divided (bending the space). Since we do not know from the beginning how to ``devise the situation on the divided side (bending the space)'', we need to decide on the method through trial and error.

When investigating something, we would like to investigate based on as accurate data as possible, but we started by talking about how to collect it. Ideal. A typical survey method is a complete survey that examines the entire population and the survey results are absolutely true. It is only conducted when the environment is in place or when the population size is small, such as the grades of students in the class.The method taken there is a sample survey in which a part of the population is selected and investigated. There are two types of sampling methods for sample surveys: significant sampling and random sampling.Significant sampling is the selection of samples based on independent judgment.An example of this is the convenience of selecting samples from survey subjects that are easy to collect. Significant sampling makes it easier to collect data because you can narrow down the sample based on your own judgment, but in many cases the sample does not represent the entire population, and if your own judgment is wrong, you may get data that is not true. I might put it away.\\r\\nWhen selecting samples, sample selection bias may occur. To avoid this, we can randomly select a sample directly from the population. Such a method is called a simple random sampling method, and dice and roulette are typical examples. There is also a multistage sampling method that randomly selects a group and randomly samples within the group. A common sample selection bias is, for example, predicting the future from past data, but there is no guarantee that the past and future conditions will be the same. There is also survivorship bias. This occurs in cases where post-enrollment data for unsuccessful students is not available, even when trying to extrapolate post-enrollment performance from entrance exam scores. In addition, minorities may be discriminated against because of a biased sample drawn. Street interviews by the media can be said to be the worst form of sample selection bias because they report only arbitrarily selected opinions as if they were generalizations. In addition to sample selection bias, inductive bias, which depends on the nature of the method used and can lead to different results if different methods are used, is also used as a clue when analyzing data or using it for AI. Annotation bias etc. caused by annotation may occur.\\r\\nNext, we talked about data that should be properly protected and data that should be actively used. A representative example of the former is personal information, and a representative example of the latter is open data. Personal information refers to information about a living individual that can identify a specific individual or that includes an individual identification code. The Act on the Protection of Personal Information was created to protect this, and the goal is to maintain an appropriate balance between protection and use, rather than simply restricting its use. In principle, personal information cannot be provided to a third party without the consent of the data owner. Exceptions may be made if the information has been submitted to the Information Protection Commission or if the information has been processed anonymously.\\r\\nOpen data refers to open data that can be used for secondary purposes, is machine-readable, and can be used free of charge, among the data held by administrative agencies. Here, \\\"secondary use\\\" means \\\"may be used for commercial purposes\\\", and \\\"machine-readable\\\" means \\\"numerical data that is not PDF or images\\\". The significance of open data includes the resolution of various issues through the promotion of public participation and public-private collaboration, the sophistication and acceleration of administration, the improvement of transparency and reliability, and the resolution of various regional issues. The use of open data is encouraged by the Basic Act on the Promotion of Public and Private Sector Data Utilization, which obliges local governments to take necessary measures so that citizens can easily use the public and private sector data they possess. etc., are being used.

      "4828:{\"code\":200,\"text\":\"\\\"We divide unstructured data processing into three categories: language processing, image processing, and voice/music processing.\\r\\nFirst, let's talk about language processing. In the first place, language data is data represented by a character string. A technique for analyzing this language data by a computer is called natural language processing. Examples include frequent language (the process of finding the most frequently occurring word in language data), translation, searching, proofreading, and dialogue. In addition, ``semantic analysis'' that finds the connections between words and assigns meaning, ``sentiment analysis'' that infers the emotions hidden in sentences, ``sentence generation'' and ``paraphrase analysis'' are also natural language processing. It is one kind. During such processing, the computer digitizes each word or sentence according to its meaning and represents it as a vector (=set of numbers), thereby enabling calculation of words.\\r\\nNext, image processing. Since images are vectors, computers and other devices always handle very high-dimensional vectors when handling image data. Analysis of such image data includes \\\"image recognition\\\", \\\"image processing\\\" to correct the color and brightness of images, \\\"computer vision\\\" to perform 3D stereoscopic vision and tracking, \\\"image generation\\\" and \\\"feature extraction\\\". etc.\\r\\nFinally, I would like to talk about voice/music processing. By quantifying the height of sound waves, \\\"sound\\\" becomes time-series data for computers. Sound can be roughly divided into three categories: voice, music, and environmental sound. Speech data analysis includes speech/speaker/emotion recognition and speech synthesis. Music data analysis, on the other hand, includes music and acoustic analysis, music recognition, music data compression, and the like. In the case of environmental sound data, recognition of environmental sounds, separation/identification of sound sources, detection of abnormal sounds, and the like can be mentioned.\\r\\nAs described above, computers recognize various data, and this \\\"method of guessing what data is\\\" is called \\\"pattern recognition.\\\" We humans have been doing pattern recognition since childhood, and we can do it unconsciously, with high precision, and at high speed. However, pattern recognition is still difficult for computers.
